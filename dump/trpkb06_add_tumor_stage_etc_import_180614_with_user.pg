1	CCND1	595	{BCL1," D11S287E"," PRAD1"," U21B31"}	cyclin D1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance throughout the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with and functions as a regulatory subunit of CDK4 or CDK6, whose activity is required for cell cycle G1/S transition. This protein has been shown to interact with tumor suppressor protein Rb and the expression of this gene is regulated positively by Rb. Mutations, amplification and overexpression of this gene, which alters cell cycle progression, are observed frequently in a variety of tumors and may contribute to tumorigenesis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
2	BIRC5	332	{API4," EPR-1"}	baculoviral IAP repeat containing 5	protein-coding	This gene is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family, which encode negative regulatory proteins that prevent apoptotic cell death. IAP family members usually contain multiple baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains, but this gene encodes proteins with only a single BIR domain. The encoded proteins also lack a C-terminus RING finger domain. Gene expression is high during fetal development and in most tumors, yet low in adult tissues. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].
3	XRCC4	7518	{SSMED}	X-ray repair cross complementing 4	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene functions together with DNA ligase IV and the DNA-dependent protein kinase in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. This protein plays a role in both non-homologous end joining and the completion of V(D)J recombination. Mutations in this gene can cause short stature, microcephaly, and endocrine dysfunction (SSMED). Alternative splicing generates several transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015].
4	XRCC5	7520	{KARP-1," KARP1"," KU80"," KUB2"," Ku86"," NFIV"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 5	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is the 80-kilodalton subunit of the Ku heterodimer protein which is also known as ATP-dependant DNA helicase II or DNA repair protein XRCC5. Ku is the DNA-binding component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase, and it functions together with the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex in the repair of DNA double-strand break by non-homologous end joining and the completion of V(D)J recombination events.  This gene functionally complements Chinese hamster xrs-6, a mutant defective in DNA double-strand break repair and in ability to undergo V(D)J recombination. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
5	XRCC6	2547	{CTC75," CTCBF"," G22P1"," KU70"," ML8"," TLAA"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 6	protein-coding	The p70/p80 autoantigen is a nuclear complex consisting of two subunits with molecular masses of approximately 70 and 80 kDa. The complex functions as a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATP-dependent helicase. The complex may be involved in the repair of nonhomologous DNA ends such as that required for double-strand break repair, transposition, and V(D)J recombination. High levels of autoantibodies to p70 and p80 have been found in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
6	PRKDC	5591	{DNA-PKcs," DNAPK"," DNPK1"," HYRC"," HYRC1"," IMD26"," XRCC7"," p350"}	protein kinase, DNA-activated, catalytic polypeptide	protein-coding	This gene encodes the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). It functions with the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer protein in DNA double strand break repair and recombination. The protein encoded is a member of the PI3/PI4-kinase family.[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2010].
7	LIG4	3981	{LIG4S}	DNA ligase 4	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a DNA ligase that joins single-strand breaks in a double-stranded polydeoxynucleotide in an ATP-dependent reaction. This protein is essential for V(D)J recombination and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). This protein forms a complex with the X-ray repair cross complementing protein 4 (XRCC4), and further interacts with the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Both XRCC4 and DNA-PK are known to be required for NHEJ. The crystal structure of the complex formed by this protein and XRCC4 has been resolved. Defects in this gene are the cause of LIG4 syndrome. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been observed. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
8	DCLRE1C	64421	{A-SCID," DCLREC1C"," RS-SCID"," SCIDA"," SNM1C"}	DNA cross-link repair 1C	protein-coding	This gene encodes a nuclear protein that is involved in V(D)J recombination and DNA repair. The encoded protein has single-strand-specific 5'-3' exonuclease activity; it also exhibits endonuclease activity on 5' and 3' overhangs and hairpins. The protein also functions in the regulation of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Mutations in this gene can cause Athabascan-type severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA) and Omenn syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014].
9	APEX1	328	{APE," APE1"," APEN"," APEX"," APX"," HAP1"," REF1"}	apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1	protein-coding	Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites occur frequently in DNA molecules by spontaneous hydrolysis, by DNA damaging agents or by DNA glycosylases that remove specific abnormal bases. AP sites are pre-mutagenic lesions that can prevent normal DNA replication so the cell contains systems to identify and repair such sites. Class II AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester backbone 5' to the AP site. This gene encodes the major AP endonuclease in human cells. Splice variants have been found for this gene; all encode the same protein. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
10	XRCC1	7515	{RCC," SCAR26"}	X-ray repair cross complementing 1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is involved in the efficient repair of DNA single-strand breaks formed by exposure to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. This protein interacts with DNA ligase III, polymerase beta and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase to participate in the base excision repair pathway. It may play a role in DNA processing during meiogenesis and recombination in germ cells. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
29	RB1	5925	{OSRC," PPP1R130"," RB"," p105-Rb"," pRb"," pp110"}	RB transcriptional corepressor 1	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a negative regulator of the cell cycle and was the first tumor suppressor gene found. The encoded protein also stabilizes constitutive heterochromatin to maintain the overall chromatin structure. The active, hypophosphorylated form of the protein binds transcription factor E2F1. Defects in this gene are a cause of childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB), bladder cancer, and osteogenic sarcoma. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
11	ERCC1	2067	{COFS4," RAD10"," UV20"}	ERCC excision repair 1, endonuclease non-catalytic subunit	protein-coding	The product of this gene functions in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, and is required for the repair of DNA lesions such as those induced by UV light or formed by electrophilic compounds including cisplatin. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the XPF endonuclease (also known as ERCC4), and the heterodimeric endonuclease catalyzes the 5' incision in the process of excising the DNA lesion. The heterodimeric endonuclease is also involved in recombinational DNA repair and in the repair of inter-strand crosslinks. Mutations in this gene result in cerebrooculofacioskeletal syndrome, and polymorphisms that alter expression of this gene may play a role in carcinogenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. The last exon of this gene overlaps with the CD3e molecule, epsilon associated protein gene on the opposite strand. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009].
12	EGFR	1956	{ERBB," ERBB1"," HER1"," NISBD2"," PIG61"," mENA"}	epidermal growth factor receptor	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is a member of the protein kinase superfamily. This protein is a receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family. EGFR is a cell surface protein that binds to epidermal growth factor. Binding of the protein to a ligand induces receptor dimerization and tyrosine autophosphorylation and leads to cell proliferation. Mutations in this gene are associated with lung cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2016].
13	TP53	7157	{BCC7," LFS1"," P53"," TRP53"}	tumor protein p53	protein-coding	This gene encodes a tumor suppressor protein containing transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and oligomerization domains. The encoded protein responds to diverse cellular stresses to regulate expression of target genes, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair, or changes in metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with a variety of human cancers, including hereditary cancers such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Alternative splicing of this gene and the use of alternate promoters result in multiple transcript variants and isoforms. Additional isoforms have also been shown to result from the use of alternate translation initiation codons from identical transcript variants (PMIDs: 12032546, 20937277). [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016].
14	CDKN1A	1026	{CAP20," CDKN1"," CIP1"," MDA-6"," P21"," SDI1"," WAF1"," p21CIP1"}	cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A	protein-coding	This gene encodes a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The encoded protein binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase2 or -cyclin-dependent kinase4 complexes, and thus functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression at G1. The expression of this gene is tightly controlled by the tumor suppressor protein p53, through which this protein mediates the p53-dependent cell cycle G1 phase arrest in response to a variety of stress stimuli. This protein can interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase accessory factor, and plays a regulatory role in S phase DNA replication and DNA damage repair. This protein was reported to be specifically cleaved by CASP3-like caspases, which thus leads to a dramatic activation of cyclin-dependent kinase2, and may be instrumental in the execution of apoptosis following caspase activation. Mice that lack this gene have the ability to regenerate damaged or missing tissue. Multiple alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2015].
15	MKI67	4288	{KIA," MIB-"," MIB-1"," PPP1R105"}	marker of proliferation Ki-67	protein-coding	This gene encodes a nuclear protein that is associated with and may be necessary for cellular proliferation. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described. A related pseudogene exists on chromosome X. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009].
16	BCL2	596	{Bcl-2," PPP1R50"}	BCL2, apoptosis regulator	protein-coding	This gene encodes an integral outer mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks the apoptotic death of some cells such as lymphocytes. Constitutive expression of BCL2, such as in the case of translocation of BCL2 to Ig heavy chain locus, is thought to be the cause of follicular lymphoma. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016].
17	BAX	581	{BCL2L4}	BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the BCL2 protein family. BCL2 family members form hetero- or homodimers and act as anti- or pro-apoptotic regulators that are involved in a wide variety of cellular activities. This protein forms a heterodimer with BCL2, and functions as an apoptotic activator. This protein is reported to interact with, and increase the opening of, the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), which leads to the loss in membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. The expression of this gene is regulated by the tumor suppressor P53 and has been shown to be involved in P53-mediated apoptosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode different isoforms, have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
18	HDAC1	3065	{GON-10," HD1"," RPD3"," RPD3L1"}	histone deacetylase 1	protein-coding	Histone acetylation and deacetylation, catalyzed by multisubunit complexes, play a key role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the histone deacetylase/acuc/apha family and is a component of the histone deacetylase complex. It also interacts with retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor protein and this complex is a key element in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Together with metastasis-associated protein-2, it deacetylates p53 and modulates its effect on cell growth and apoptosis. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

Glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are a family of G protein-coupled receptors, that have been divided into 3 groups on the basis of sequence homology, putative signal transduction mechanisms, and pharmacologic properties. Group I includes GRM1 and GRM5 and these receptors have been shown to activate phospholipase C. Group II includes GRM2 and GRM3 while Group III includes GRM4, GRM6, GRM7 and GRM8. Group II and III receptors are linked to the inhibition of the cyclic AMP cascade but differ in their agonist selectivities.

It has been implicated as the key inductive signal in patterning of the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral somites. Of three human proteins showing sequence and functional similarity to the sonic hedgehog protein of Drosophila, this protein is the most similar. The protein is made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the developing embryo. Defects in this protein or in its signalling pathway are a cause of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a disorder in which the developing forebrain fails to correctly separate into right and left hemispheres. HPE is manifested by facial deformities. It is also thought that mutations in this gene or in its signalling pathway may be responsible for VACTERL syndrome, which is characterized by vertebral defects, anal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia, radial and renal dysplasia, cardiac anomalies, and limb abnormalities.

148	MIR146A	406938	{MIRN146," MIRN146A"," miR-146a"," miRNA146A"}	microRNA 146a	ncRNA	microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. Some of the targets of the encoded miRNA are the transcripts for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, interleukin 1-beta, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, and complement factor H.

The encoded protein may inhibit chemotaxis and invasion and thereby attenuate metastasis in malignant melanomas. Studies suggest a putative role in the regulation of events downstream of cell-matrix adhesion, perhaps involving cytoskeletal reorganization. A protein product of this gene, kisspeptin, stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced gonadotropin secretion and regulates the pubertal activation of GnRH nuerons. A polymorphism in the terminal exon of this mRNA results in two protein isoforms. An adenosine present at the polymorphic site represents the third position in a stop codon. When the adenosine is absent, a downstream stop codon is utilized and the encoded protein extends for an additional seven amino acid residues. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012].

ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies (ABC1, MDR/TAP, MRP, ALD, OABP, GCN20, White). This protein is a member of the MDR/TAP subfamily. Members of the MDR/TAP subfamily are involved in multidrug resistance. The protein encoded by this gene is an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump for xenobiotic compounds with broad substrate specificity. It is responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells and often mediates the development of resistance to anticancer drugs. This protein also functions as a transporter in the blood-brain barrier. Mutations in this gene are associated with colchicine resistance and Inflammatory bowel disease 13.

It maps to a region on chromosome 1p36 that is frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and other tumors, and thought to contain multiple tumor suppressor genes. The demonstration that this gene is monoallelically expressed (likely from the maternal allele), supports the notion that it is a candidate gene for neuroblastoma. Many transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing and/or use of alternate promoters have been found for this gene, but the biological validity and the full-length nature of some variants have not been determined.

158	FADD	8772	{GIG3," MORT1"}	Fas associated via death domain	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is an adaptor molecule that interacts with various cell surface receptors and mediates cell apoptotic signals. Through its C-terminal death domain, this protein can be recruited by TNFRSF6/Fas-receptor, tumor necrosis factor receptor, TNFRSF25, and TNFSF10/TRAIL-receptor, and thus it participates in the death signaling initiated by these receptors. Interaction of this protein with the receptors unmasks the N-terminal effector domain of this protein, which allows it to recruit caspase-8, and thereby activate the cysteine protease cascade. Knockout studies in mice also suggest the importance of this protein in early T cell development. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

HMW-uPA can be further processed into the catalytically active low molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (LMW-uPA). This low molecular weight form does not bind to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Quebec platelet disorder and late-onset Alzheimer's disease.

Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group D2.

The 105 kD protein is a Rel protein-specific transcription inhibitor and the 50 kD protein is a DNA binding subunit of the NF-kappa-B (NFKB) protein complex. NFKB is a transcription regulator that is activated by various intra- and extra-cellular stimuli such as cytokines, oxidant-free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, and bacterial or viral products. Activated NFKB translocates into the nucleus and stimulates the expression of genes involved in a wide variety of biological functions. Inappropriate activation of NFKB has been associated with a number of inflammatory diseases while persistent inhibition of NFKB leads to inappropriate immune cell development or delayed cell growth.

Importin-alpha binds the NLS, while importin-beta mediates translocation through the nuclear pore complex. After translocation, RanGTP binds importin-beta and displaces importin-alpha. Importin-alpha must then be returned to the cytoplasm, leaving the NLS protein behind. The protein encoded by this gene binds strongly to NLS-free importin-alpha, and this binding is released in the cytoplasm by the combined action of RANBP1 and RANGAP1.

This protein is activated by, and mediates the responses of many cell ligands, such as IL2, IL3, IL7 GM-CSF, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, and different growth hormones. Activation of this protein in myeloma and lymphoma associated with a TEL/JAK2 gene fusion is independent of cell stimulus and has been shown to be essential for tumorigenesis. The mouse counterpart of this gene is found to induce the expression of BCL2L1/BCL-X(L), which suggests the antiapoptotic function of this gene in cells.

It functions not only as an adhesion molecule, but also as a potent signalling molecule. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

This gene functionally complements Chinese hamster irs1SF, a repair-deficient mutant that exhibits hypersensitivity to a number of different DNA-damaging agents and is chromosomally unstable. A rare microsatellite polymorphism in this gene is associated with cancer in patients of varying radiosensitivity.

The action of this enzyme includes lyase activity for chain cleavage. Alternative splicing of the C-terminal region of this gene classifies splice variants into two major groups, type 1 and type 2, depending on the last exon of the sequence. Type 1 alternative splice variants end with exon 7 and type 2 end with exon 8. All variants share the N-terminal region in common, which contains a mitochondrial targeting signal that is essential for mitochondrial localization. Many alternative splice variants for this gene have been described, but the full-length nature for every variant has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2008].
245	HDGF	3068	{HMG1L2}	heparin binding growth factor	protein-coding	This gene encodes a member of the hepatoma-derived growth factor family. The encoded protein has mitogenic and DNA-binding activity and may play a role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. High levels of expression of this gene enhance the growth of many tumors. This gene was thought initially to be located on chromosome X; however, that location has been determined to correspond to a related pseudogene. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].

The encoded protein associates with several multisubunit transcriptional complexes and with protein complexes involved in both ATP-dependent remodeling and histone modification. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2016].
248	CD34	947	{""}	CD34 molecule	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene may play a role in the attachment of stem cells to the bone marrow extracellular matrix or to stromal cells.

249	PTPN13	5783	{FAP-1," PNP1"," PTP-BAS"," PTP-BL"," PTP1E"," PTPL1"," PTPLE"," hPTP1E"}	protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 13	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family. PTPs are signaling molecules that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, differentiation, mitotic cycle, and oncogenic transformation. This PTP is a large intracellular protein. It has a catalytic PTP domain at its C-terminus and two major structural domains: a region with five PDZ domains and a FERM domain that binds to plasma membrane and cytoskeletal elements. This PTP was found to interact with, and dephosphorylate, Fas receptor and IkappaBalpha through the PDZ domains. This suggests it has a role in Fas mediated programmed cell death. This PTP was also shown to interact with GTPase-activating protein, and thus may function as a regulator of Rho signaling pathways. Four alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct proteins, have been reported. [provided by RefSeq, Oct 2008].
250	PTEN	5728	{10q23del," BZS"," CWS1"," DEC"," GLM2"," MHAM"," MMAC1"," PTEN1"," PTENbeta"," TEP1"}	phosphatase and tensin homolog	protein-coding	This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine, and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 9. Alternative splicing and the use of multiple translation start codons results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2015].

MAP kinases, also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), act as an integration point for multiple biochemical signals, and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription regulation and development. The activation of this kinase requires its phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein, but differing in the UTRs, have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014].

S100 proteins are localized in the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of a wide range of cells, and involved in the regulation of a number of cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. S100 genes include at least 13 members which are located as a cluster on chromosome 1q21. This protein may function in the inhibition of casein kinase and altered expression of this protein is associated with the disease cystic fibrosis. This antimicrobial protein exhibits antifungal and antibacterial activity. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2014].
253	GHR	2690	{GHBP," GHIP"}	growth hormone receptor	protein-coding	This gene encodes a member of the type I cytokine receptor family, which is a transmembrane receptor for growth hormone. Binding of growth hormone to the receptor leads to receptor dimerization and the activation of an intra- and intercellular signal transduction pathway leading to growth. Mutations in this gene have been associated with Laron syndrome, also known as the growth hormone insensitivity syndrome (GHIS), a disorder characterized by short stature. In humans and rabbits, but not rodents, growth hormone binding protein (GHBP) is generated by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular ligand-binding domain from the mature growth hormone receptor protein. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011].

1	Association of cyclin D1 and survivin expression with sensitivity to radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24615109	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24615109	Journal Article	\N	72	55	17	41	\N	[20.0,69.0)	Immunohistochemistry	High expression: positive cells >50%.	The radiation therapy used the X-ray from a 6 MeV medical linear accelerator, with 200 cGy conventional fractionated irradiation once a day, five times a week. The nasopharynx dose (DT) was 7000 to 7800 cGy, 35 to 39 times for 7 to 8 weeks.	Radiotherapy	5	The association between cyclin D1 and survivin protein expressions with radiotherapy sensitivity in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was investigated. Biopsy specimens of 72 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were collected before the initiation of radiotherapy (49 cases were in the radiation-sensitive group and 23 cases were in the radiation-insensitive group). Conventional hematoxylin and eosin staining was used for tissue typing. The immunohistochemical SP method was used to detect cyclin D1 and survivin protein expression levels. The IBM SPSS Statistics 20 statistical software was applied for conducting the chi-squared test and the Spearman correlation analysis. In the 72 cases, the high expression rates of cyclin D1 were 28.6% (14/49) and 69.6% (16/23) in the radiotherapy-sensitive group and in the radiotherapy-insensitive group, respectively, and the differences between groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). The high expression rates of survivin were 34.7% (17/49) and 73.9% (17/23) in the radiotherapy-sensitive group and in the radiotherapy-insensitive group, respectively, which differed significantly (P<0.05). The protein expressions of cyclin D1 and survivin were positively correlated (Spearman's r=0.353, P<0.05). Cyclin D1 and survivin expression levels were negatively correlated with the radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Cyclin D1 and survivin may be used as molecular markers to predict the sensitivity of radiotherapy.

2	Prognostic significance of cyclin D1 protein levels in early-stage larynx cancer treated with primary radiation	English	2000	10725854	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725854	Journal Article	\N	60	50	10	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	An H-score (defined as the product of intensity and distribution) of ≥10 was used as a cut-off for CCND1 overexpression.	All patients were treated with primary radiation therapy, without systemic chemotherapy or surgical resection, to a median total dose of 66 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy using conventional external beam 4-6 MeV photon irradiation.	Radiotherapy	5	Recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that cyclin D1 levels (cycD1) can influence radiosensitivity. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the prognostic significance of cycD1 for local recurrence in early-stage larynx cancer treated with primary radiation therapy. The study was conducted using a matched case-control design in 60 early-stage (T1-T2/N0) larynx cancer patients. All patients had squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and were treated with primary radiation to a total median dose of 66 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, without surgery or chemotherapy. Thirty patients who suffered a local relapse in the larynx after treatment served as the index case population. These 30 cases were matched by age, sex, site (glottic vs. supraglottic), radiation therapy technique/dose, and follow-up, to 30 control patients who did not experience a local relapse. Immunohistochemical staining from cycD1 was performed on the paraffin-embedded specimens. The pathologist, blinded to the clinical information, scored each of the specimens on a four-point intensity scale (0 = no stain, 1 = faint, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong) and percent distribution. Patients were considered to be positive for cyclin D1 if the staining was 2+ or greater with a percent distribution of at least 5%. By design of the study, the two groups were evenly balanced with respect to age, sex, stage, radiation dose, and follow-up. CycD1 levels correlated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels. Low levels of cycD1 significantly correlated with local relapse; 19/30 (63%) of the index cases stained negative, while only 10/30 (33%) of the control cases stained negative (P = 0.03). These data suggest that low levels of cycD1 correlate with relatively radioresistant early-stage larynx carcinoma. With larger more confirmatory clinical and laboratory data, this data may have significant clinical implications.	International Journal of Cancer	Stage I-II: 60 patients.

The mRNA levels of 6 genes listed were analyzed by quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) in pre-treatment biopsies obtained from 42 squamous cervical cancer patients, and the association between mRNA levels and the response of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were further investigated. The response rate and was 47.6% in patients with high XRCC6 mRNA expression level and 90.5% in patients with low mRNA expression level of XRCC6 (P=0.003). No statistically association was identified between the response rate and the mRNA expression level in each of the rest five genes. Multiple logistic regression analysis also reveled that the expression of XRCC6 mRNA level was significantly associated with the response to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (P=0.008). The results showed that the expression of XRCC6 mRNA was closely consistented with the sensitivity to concurrent chemoradiotherapy, suggesting that XRCC6 can be used as a predictive molecular marker in the clinical treatment of squamous cell cervical carcinoma.

4	Analysis and results of Ku and XRCC4 expression in hypopharyngeal cancer tissues treated with chemoradiotherapy	English	2012	22807979	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22807979	Journal Article	\N	57	48	9	\N	63	[33.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	In 51 of the 57 patients, chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy. Six patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. The chemotherapy consisted of FP (cisplatin plus 5FU) or S-1. FP was used in 39 patients and S-1 in 12 patients. FP consisted of cisplatin 40-60 mg/㎡ intravenously and 5FU 400-700 mg/body/day for 4 days by continuous venous infusion. S-1 (50-80 mg/body) was orally administered during periods of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	DNA double-strand break (DSB) is one of the most serious forms of damage induced by ionizing irradiation. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a key mechanism of DNA DSB repair. The immunohistochemical analysis of proteins involved in NHEJ may have potential as a predictive assay for tumor radiosensitivity. We examined the correlation between the expression of proteins involved in DNA DSB in biopsy specimens and the results of chemoradiotherapy in hypopharyngeal cancers. Fifty-seven patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx were treated between March 2002 and December 2009. Most patients (75%) had stage III or IV disease. The chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin plus 5FU or S-1. A tumor dose of 50 Gy was usually administered to the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. Doses of 10-20 Gy were usually added to the primary tumor with reduced fields after 50 Gy. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 100% for patients in stage I, 90% in stage II, 64% in stage III and 50% in stage IV. In stages I-III, patients with a lower expression of Ku70 or XRCC4 tended to have better locoregional control. These results indicated that a lower expression of Ku70 or XRCC4 may be correlated with higher radiosensitivity. Two patients had distant metastasis alone, of which one had 0% expression of Ku70 and the other had 0% expression of Ku86. The absence of Ku70 or Ku86 expression indicates low DNA-PK activity. Low DNA-PK activity due to a low expression of Ku may result in the genetic alteration of cancer cells, leading to a higher tendency of distant metastasis. This finding suggests that proteins involved in NHEJ may have an impact on the treatment results of chemoradiotherapy in hypopharyngeal cancer.

5	APE1 and XRCC1 protein expression levels predict cancer-specific survival following radical radiotherapy in bladder cancer	English	2005	16144922	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16144922	Journal Article	\N	90	68	22	75	\N	[44.0,99.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients received computerized tomography-planned radical radiotherapy to a dose ranging from 50 to 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks, to the whole bladder with a 1.5-cm margin on the tumor-bearing wall and 1 cm to the remainder of the bladder.	Radiotherapy	5	INTRODUCTION: Radiotherapy offers the potential of bladder preservation in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but only a proportion of tumors respond, and there are no accurate predictive methods. The ability of tumor cells to repair DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation influences radiosensitivity. We therefore investigated the prognostic value of the DNA repair proteins APE1 and XRCC1 in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated by radical radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tumors of 90 patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma and known clinical outcomes were immunostained with APE1 and XRCC1 antibodies. Levels of protein expression were assessed as a percentage of tumor cells with positive nuclear staining (1,000 cells per tumor). RESULTS: The median percentage of nuclear staining for APE1 was 98.7% (range, 42.2-100%) and for XRCC1 was 96.5% (range, 0.6-99.6%). High expression levels of APE1 or XRCC1 (> or = 95% positivity) were associated with improved patient cancer-specific survival (log-rank, P = 0.02 and 0.006, respectively). In a multivariate Cox regression model, APE1 and XRCC1 expression and hydronephrosis were the only independent predictors of patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Expression levels of both APE1 and XRCC1 proteins were strongly associated with patient outcome following radiotherapy, separating patients with good outcome from the 50% with poor outcome (82% and 44%, 3-year cause-specific survival, respectively). If prospectively validated, this simple test could be incorporated into clinical practice to select patients likely to respond to radiotherapy and consider alternative forms of therapy for those unlikely to respond.

6	Expression of Excision Repair Cross-Complementation Group 1 as Predictive Marker for Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treated With Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy	English	2011	21621119	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621119	Journal Article	\N	77	62	15	49	\N	[17.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	ERCC1-positive tumors were deﬁned those with greater than the median value, which was calculated from all the H-scores.	The external bean RT (radiotherapy) technique administered to patients was a three-dimensional conventional RT method. The primary tumor site and adjacent tissues were treated with 70 Gy in 35 fractions for 7 weeks using a shrinking-ﬁeld technique. For all patients, three cycles of concurrent cisplatin were administered during Weeks 1, 4, and 7 of RT. Subsequently, three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of a combination of cisplatin and 5-ﬂuorouracil, were administered between Weeks 11 and 19. RT or chemotherapy was delayed or discontinued in the event of patient refusal, physician decision, or unacceptable toxicities, including severe sepsis or renal impairment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer. The expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) has been reported to be associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. We evaluated whether ERCC1 expression could predict the treatment response and survival outcome of patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer who were treated with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of ERCC1 in nasopharyngeal tumor tissue. Patients were categorized into either a resistant or sensitive group depending on their treatment response outcome. A total of 77 patients were assessed in the present study. RESULTS: The resistant and sensitive groups included 25 and 52 patients, respectively. ERCC1 expression was positive in the tumor tissue for 39 of the 77 patients (51%). Significantly more ERCC1-negative tumors were in the sensitive group than in the resistant group (p = .035). In terms of survival outcome, univariate analysis determined that patients with ERCC1-negative tumors had longer disease-free survival (p = .076) and overall survival (p = .013) than patients with ERCC1-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis determined that negative ERCC expression in tumors was an independent predictor for prolonged overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.71). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ERCC1 expression might be a useful predictive marker in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer who are under consideration for cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

7	The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor results in a worse prognosis for patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy: a multicenter, retrospective analysis	English	2005	15816107	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15816107	Journal Article	\N	87	64	23	66	\N	[34.0,92.0)	Immunohistochemistry	EGFR was said to have positive staining (EGFR positive) when extension was 5% or more. When the extension was less than 5% (score 1) it was considered as negative staining (EGFR negative). We deﬁned highly positive expression when extension was > 50% and/or grade 3 intensity (EGFR >50).	All patients received conventional fractionation, 1.80 Gy/day, 5 fractions per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. In 8 patients, a 5.4 Gy boost to the tumor was given. Fifty patients received simultaneous chemotherapy. Two schedules were used: in 33 patients, 2 courses of 5-FU (350 mg/㎡ iv bolus 1 h prior to radiotherapy on days 1 through 5 and on days 29 through 33) and leucovorin calcium (20 mg/㎡ iv bolus immediately before each dose of 5-FU). Seventeen were treated with oral ﬂuoropirimides UFT 500 mg/day and leucovorin 60 mg/day, daily during radiotherapy. Patients were restaged by physical examination, pelvic CT, chest X-ray and blood chemistries, between 4 and 8 weeks later. Subsequently, all patients underwent surgery; 51 having low anterior resection (58%) and 36-abdominoperineal removal (42%).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is observed in 50-70% of colorectal carcinoma and is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of EGFR status before radiotherapy in a group of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-seven patients were studied retrospectively. Treatment consisted of pelvic radiotherapy, in 50 patients with concomitant chemotherapy and surgical resection. Immunohistochemistry for EGFR was determined at the preradiation biopsy and in the resected specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis for EGFR expression was evaluated according to extension and staining intensity. We defined positive staining (EGFR positive), when extension was 5% or more. RESULTS: A total of 52 of 87 tumors showed EGFR positive status at biopsy (60%) and EGFR expression was associated neither with clinical tumor stage nor with clinical nodal stage. EGFR positive expression was linked to a lack of pathologic complete response to preoperative radiotherapy (P=0.006). Disease-free survival was lower among patients with EGFR positive status before radiotherapy (P=0.003). In a multivariate analysis EGFR expression at biopsy was a statistically significant predictor of disease-free survival, RR=2.88(1.1-7.8), P=0.036. CONCLUSIONS: EGFR is expressed in a significant number of rectal tumors. EGFR-positive expression before radiotherapy is an indicator for poor response and low disease-free survival.

8	Bax, a predictive marker for therapeutic response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal carcinoma 	English	2005	15891997	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15891997	Journal Article	\N	130	90	40	\N	57	[27.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For statistical analysis, the cut-off values for positive expression were 10% or more for T53, CDKN1A, BCL2, BAX, and HDAC1 and 50% or more for MKI67, GRM4, and XRCC6.	All patients received preoperative CRT (chemoradiotherapy) consisting of 2 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (400 mg/㎡ per day) or capecitabine (oral fluoropyrimidine carbamate converting to 5-FU; 1650 mg/㎡ per day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡ per day), concurrent with 50.4 Gy of pelvic irradiation. All patients completed neoadjuvant treatment and waited 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT before having curative radical resection. For 5 days in each of four 28-day cycles, 84 patients underwent postop- erative chemotherapy consisting of 5-FU (425 mg/㎡ per day intravenous bolus) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡ per day intravenous bolus); 29 patients had been previously reported.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	In an attempt to improve local control and survival in patients with advanced rectal carcinoma, neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) has been increasingly used in patient management. However, a significant proportion of patients shows poor response to adjuvant CRT. Thus, the ability to predict CRT responsiveness in patients with rectal cancer would benefit effective management. Several molecular markers related to regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, or DNA repair have been proposed as candidate predictors of therapeutic response to CRT, but, to date, none has been definitively proven to be predictive of CRT response. To evaluate the use of various molecular markers as predictors of the response to CRT in rectal carcinoma, we investigated immunohistochemical expressions of p53, p21 WAF1/CIP1 , Bcl-2, Bax, Ki-67, Ku-70, and 2 new candidate markers (histone deacetylase 1 and metabotropic glutamate receptor 4) in pretreatment biopsy samples of 130 rectal carcinomas. We further compared the expressions of these molecular markers with the pathological responses of the tumors after therapy. We found that Bax expression, among the markers studied, was exclusively related to tumor regression. Its expression was significantly higher in the complete response group as compared with the partial response group (54% versus 29%, P = .017). This result confirms that apoptosis plays an important role in tumor response to CRT and provides evidence that Bax may serve as a predictable molecular marker for chemoradiosensitivity in rectal carcinoma.

9	p53, deleted in colorectal cancer gene, and thymidylate synthase as predictors of histopathologic response and survival in low, locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative adjuvant therapy	English	2003	12576893	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12576893	Journal Article	\N	60	42	18	59	\N	[35.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	TP53 positive was determined by the presence of brown reaction product within the nuclei of neoplastic cells.Tumors were classified as negative (no nuclear staining) or positive (any number of nuclei staining). The same assessment method was used for TYMS.	Patients were treated with 6-MV photons by a 4-field pelvis technique. The fields extended from the L5/S1 level superiorly to the bottom of the obturator foramina inferiorly, with a 1-cm to 1.5-cm margin on the bony pelvic inlet. A total dose of 4,500 cGy in 25 fractions (with concurrent chemotherapy) or 5,040 cGy in 28 fractions (radiotherapy alone) was delivered over 5 to 6 weeks, with all fields treated daily. When given, 5-FU was administered as a bolus injection at 350 mg/㎡ with concurrent leucovorin at 20 mg/㎡ on Days 1 through 5 during the first and last weeks of pelvic radiation therapy. Surgical resection with curative intent was undertaken four to six weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. 35 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 25 in the radiotherapy group. Nineteen patients underwent abdominoperineal resections; 33 underwent anterior resections, of which 25 were ultra-low anterior resections; 2 had local excisions; and the remaining 6 were not resected because of advanced disease (widespread intra-abdominal metastases at the time of laparotomy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Adjuvant therapy, either preoperatively or postoperatively, and modifications of surgery have been used to try to improve outcome of surgery for rectal cancer in regard to both local recurrence and survival. Assessment of prognosis in patients after resection is currently primarily based on clinicopathologic factors. These predict the subsequent behavior of the tumor only imperfectly. The aim of this study was to evaluate three potential molecular genetic markers of prognosis (p53, deleted in colorectal cancer gene, and thymidylate synthase) in Dukes Stage B and C low rectal tumors treated with adjuvant therapy and to determine whether they correlate with survival, local recurrence, or the pathologic response to adjuvant therapy (assessed by extent of tumor regression and tumor down-staging). METHODS: Sixty locally advanced low rectal tumors resected after preoperative chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone were studied by immunohistochemical staining for p53, deleted in colorectal cancer gene, and thymidylate synthase. In addition, p53 gene mutations were sought by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. These results were correlated with survival, local recurrence, and pathologic response to adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: Lack of thymidylate synthase staining by immunohistochemistry was associated with tumor down-staging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy but not after radiotherapy or for these two combined groups. There was no correlation between p53, deleted in colorectal cancer gene, or thymidylate synthase immunohistochemical staining or between p53 polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and local recurrence or survival in locally advanced low rectal cancers treated with preoperative adjuvant therapies. CONCLUSION: Prediction of prognosis in patients with locally advanced low rectal cancers treated with preoperative adjuvant therapies continues to be problematic. Thymidylate synthase immunohistochemistry appears to be the most promising factor of those assessed in predicting tumor down-staging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced low rectal cancers.

Preoperative radiation was given as an external total tumor dose of 60 Gy combined with an intracavitary boost of a 5 Gy single fraction to the tumor bed. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of oral Uftoral 300/mg/㎡ daily and leucovorin 22.5 mg/daily 5 days a week. The operation was performed 8 weeks posttreatment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been associated with radioresistance in solid tumors. Recently a polymorphism in the Sp1 recognition site of the EGFR promoter region was identified. The present study investigated the predictive value of this polymorphism for the outcome of chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study included 77 patients with locally advanced T3 rectal tumors. Treatment consisted of preoperative radiation therapy at a total tumor dose of 65 Gy and concomitant chemotherapy with Uftoral. Blood samples from 63 patients were evaluated for Sp1 -216 G/T polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Forty-eight primary tumor biopsies were available for EGFR immunostaining. Patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Pathologic response evaluation was performed according to the tumor regression grade (TRG) system. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent had major response (TRG1-2) and 51% moderate response (TRG 3-4) to chemoradiation. The rates of major response were 34% (10/29) in GG homozygote patients compared with 65% (22/34) in patients with T containing variants (p=0.023). Fifty-eight percent of biopsies were positive for EGFR expression (28/48). The major response rates with regard to EGFR immunostaining were not significantly different. EGFR-positive tumors were found in 83% of the GG homozygote patients compared with 38% of patients with TT or GT variants (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation between EGFR Sp1 -216 G/T polymorphism and treatment response to chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer. Further investigations of a second set of patient and other treatment schedules are warranted.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the utility of COX-2 expression as a response predictor for patients with rectal cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Pretreatment biopsies (PTB) from 49 patients who underwent RCT were included. COX-2 and proliferation in PTB were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and apoptosis was detected by TUNEL stain. Response to treatment was assessed by a 5-point tumor-regression grade (TRG) based on the ratio of residual tumor to fibrosis. RESULTS: Good response (TRG 1+2), moderate response (TRG 3), and poor response (TRG 4+5) were seen in 21 patients (42%), 11 patients (22%), and 17 patients (34%), respectively. Patients with COX-2 overexpression in PTB were more likely to demonstrate moderate or poor response (TRG 3+4) to treatment than were those with normal COX-2 expression (p=0.026, chi-square test). Similarly, poor response was more likely if patients had low levels of spontaneous apoptosis in PTBs (p=0.0007, chi-square test). CONCLUSIONS: COX-2 overexpression and reduced apoptosis in PTB can predict poor response of rectal cancer to RCT. As COX-2 inhibitors are commercially available, their administration to patients who overexpress COX-2 warrants assessment in clinical trials in an attempt to increase overall response rates.

12	MRE11 expression is predictive of cause-specific survival following radical radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer	English	2010	20843819	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20843819	Journal Article	\N	180	137	43	\N	\N	[42.0,92.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Cohort A patients received 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks using a CT-planned three/four field 2-dimensional cylinder technique, whereas for Cohort B patients the technique was 3D-conformal and 11% of patients received additional treatments.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Radical radiotherapy and surgery achieve similar cure rates in muscle-invasive bladder cancer, but the choice of which treatment would be most beneficial cannot currently be predicted for individual patients. The primary aim of this study was to assess whether expression of any of a panel of DNA damage signaling proteins in tumor samples taken before irradiation could be used as a predictive marker of radiotherapy response, or rather was prognostic. Protein expression of MRE11, RAD50, NBS1, ATM, and H2AX was studied by immunohistochemistry in pretreatment tumor specimens from two cohorts of bladder cancer patients (validation cohort prospectively acquired) treated with radical radiotherapy and one cohort of cystectomy patients. In the radiotherapy test cohort (n = 86), low tumor MRE11 expression was associated with worse cancer-specific survival compared with high expression [43.1% versus 68.7% 3-year cause-specific survival (CSS), P = 0.012] by Kaplan-Meier analysis. This was confirmed in the radiotherapy validation cohort (n = 93; 43.0% versus 71.2%, P = 0.020). However, in the cystectomy cohort (n = 88), MRE11 expression was not associated with cancer-specific survival, commensurate with MRE11 being a predictive marker. High MRE11 expression in the combined radiotherapy cohort had a significantly better cancer-specific survival compared with the high-expression cystectomy cohort (69.9% versus 53.8% 3-year CSS, P = 0.021). In this validated immunohistochemistry study, MRE11 protein expression was shown and confirmed as a predictive factor associated with survival following bladder cancer radiotherapy, justifying its inclusion in subsequent trial designs. MRE11 expression may ultimately allow patient selection for radiotherapy or cystectomy, thus improving overall cure rates.

13	Prognostic and predictive value of baseline and posttreatment molecular marker expression in locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy	English	2007	17445998	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17445998	Journal Article	\N	91	50	41	64	62.2999999999999972	[26.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	On the basis of percentage of tumor cells stained, the tumor samples were categorized negative or positive as follows: EGFR: <1% vs. ≥1% (both intensity and extension of staining have been evaluated and combined in a single score); VEGFA and TP53: ≤10% vs. >10%; TYMS: ≤15% vs. >15%; MIB1 and CDKN1A: ≤20% vs. >20%; for MSH2 and MLH1 tumors were classified negative or positive.	The treatment included pelvic radiotherapy (2 Gy per fraction for 25 fractions) in a large pelvic field involving the tumor mass and regional lymph nodes and concomitant 5-fluorouracil (225 mg/㎡ /day for 5 weeks) by continuous intravenous infusion using a venous central line (Port-cath). Surgery was performed 6-8 weeks after the end of combined treatment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate expression of a panel of molecular markers, including p53, p21, MLH1, MSH2, MIB-1, thymidylate synthase, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), before and after treatment in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer, to correlate the constitutive profile and dynamics of expression with pathologic response and outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Expression of biomarkers was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from 91 patients with clinical Stage II and III rectal cancer treated with preoperative pelvic radiotherapy (50 Gy) plus concurrent 5-fluorouracil by continuous intravenous infusion. RESULTS: A pathologic complete remission was observed in 14 patients (15.4%). Patients with MLH1-positive tumors had a higher pathologic complete response rate (24.3% vs. 9.4%; p = 0.055). Low expression of constitutive p21, absence of EGFR expression after chemoradiotherapy, and high Dworak's tumor regression grade (TRG) were significantly associated with improved disease-free survival and overall survival. A high MIB-1 value after chemoradiotherapy was significantly associated with worse overall survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic value of constitutive p21 expression as well as EGFR expression and MIB-1 value after chemoradiotherapy among patients not achieving TRG 3-4. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we observed the independent prognostic value of EGFR expression after chemoradiotherapy on disease-free survival. Moreover, our study suggests that a constitutive high p21 expression and a high MIB-1 value after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy treatment could predict worse outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer.

226	TOP2A overexpression as a poor prognostic factor in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	23897556	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23897556	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Those cases with H-score larger than the median value were construed as featuring TOP2A overexpression.	Of all these 124 patients with NPC, 114 patients was regularly monitored after radiotherapy until death or their last appointment with the mean follow-up duration being 67.0 months (range, 3-141). Based on the published protocol, patients with stage II-IV diseases also received cisplatin-based chemotherapy in addition to a complete course of radiotherapy (total dose ≧7,000 cGy)	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Despite the advances in diagnostic imaging and treatment modalities, the risk stratification and final outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) still remain suboptimal. Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, topoisomerase IIα (TOP2A) was first identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which implicates cell division via selective cleavage, rearrangement, and re-ligation of DNA strands. Given the roles of TOP2A in prognostication and in the frontline therapeutic regimen of common carcinomas, such as breast cancer, we explored TOP2A immunoexpression status and its associations with clinicopathological variables and survival in a well-defined cohort of NPC patients. TOP2A immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score method for biopsy specimens from 124 NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score larger than the median value were construed as featuring TOP2A overexpression. The findings were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). TOP2A overexpression was significantly associated with American Joint of Cancer Committee (AJCC) stages III-IV (p = 0.019) and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS (p = 0.0078) and DMFS (p = 0.0003). In the multivariate comparison, TOP2A overexpression remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (p = 0.047, hazard ratio = 1.732) and DMFS (p = 0.003, hazard ratio = 2.569), together with advanced AJCC stages III-IV. TOP2A expression is upregulated in a subset of NPCs and its increased immunoexpression significantly correlated with advanced stages and tumor aggressiveness, justifying the potentiality of TOP2A as a prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target of NPC.

14	DNA repair gene expression and risk of locoregional relapse in breast cancer patients	English	2010	20092964	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20092964	Journal Article	\N	97	\N	\N	\N	\N	[35.0,71.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	The trial compared concomitant adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with sequential chemotherapy plus radiotherapy and was described previously.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Radiation therapy appears to kill cells mainly by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. We investigated whether the DNA repair gene expression status might influence the risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR) in breast cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We used a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR-based approach to measure messenger RNA levels of 20 selected DNA repair genes in tumor samples from 97 breast cancer patients enrolled in a phase III trial (Centre René Huguenin cohort). Normalized mRNA levels were tested for an association with LRR-free survival (LRR-FS) and overall survival (OS). The findings were validated in comparison with those of an independent cohort (Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort). Multivariate analysis encompassing known prognostic factors was used to assess the association between DNA repair gene expression and patient outcome. RESULTS: RAD51 was the only gene associated with LRR in both cohorts. With a median follow-up of 126 months in the CRH cohort, the 5-year LRR-FS and OS rates were 100% and 95% in the 61 patients with low RAD51 expression, compared with 70% and 69% in the 36 patients with high RAD51 expression, respectively (p < 0.001). RAD51 overexpression was associated with a higher risk of LRR (hazard ratio [HR], 12.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-45.6) and death (HR, 4.10; 95% CI, 1.7-9.7). RAD51 overexpression was also significantly associated with shorter LRR-FS and OS in the NKI cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of RAD51, a key component of the homologous DNA repair pathway, is associated with poor breast cancer outcome. This finding warrants prospective studies of RAD51 as a prognosticator and therapeutic target.

15	Low hMLH1 expression prior to definitive chemoradiotherapy predicts poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2008	18053639	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053639	Journal Article	\N	51	50	1	65	\N	[50.0,83.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors containing >50% positive cancer cells were classiﬁed as showing high staining and those with 650% positive cancer cells as showing low staining.	Radiotherapy was performed using a LINAC 6- or 10-MV X-ray unit, in daily 1.8 or 2 Gy fraction at five fractions per week up to a total of 54 Gy to the primary tumor. Initially anteroposterior and posteroanterior fields were used with a craniocaudal margin of 5 cm and a transverse margin of 2 cm adjacent to the gross tumor mass as determined by chest CT or esophagography. At doses between 36 and 40 Gy, chest CT was performed for 3D-conformal radiotherapy planning and a boost dose of 14-18 Gy was delivered to clinical target volumes with a craniocaudal margin of 3 cm and a transverse margin of 2 adjacent to gross tumor volumes. Further radiotherapy boosts were administered to cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes depending on nodal size. To patients with adequate bone marrow, hepatic, and renal functions, cisplatin (75 mg/㎡) was administered intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11, and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/㎡) was administered as a continuous infusion for the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11. The first two cycles were performed with radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The present study evaluated the pretreatment expression patterns of hMLH1, MDM2, p53, and pRb protein to determine whether these could predict the outcome of definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in 51 patients with stage I-IVa esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. High immunoreactivies of hMLH1, MDM2, p53, and pRb were detected in 90.2%, 19.6%, 27.5%, and 66.7% of entire patients, respectively. High hMLH1 expression was found to favor earlier stage, less locoregional failure, and longer cause-specific survival, and all were with significance. However, the expressions of MDM2, p53, and pRb were not found to be clinically significant. Thirty-three patients with high hMLH1 and pRb expression tended to survive longer than four patients with low hMLH1 and pRb expression. We suggest that the expression of hMLH1 is a potential marker of tumor response and survival. Determinations of this protein expression might be useful for selecting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients for definitive CCRT.

16	Expression of pAkt affects p53 codon 72 polymorphism-based prediction of response to radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2013	23663243	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663243	Journal Article	\N	75	57	18	45	\N	[22.0,72.0)	Immunohistochemistry	At least 10 high-power fields were selected randomly, and >1,000 cells counted for each section. Staining intensity was graded on the following scale: 0: no staining, 1+: mild staining, 2+: moderate staining, and 3+: intense staining. The area of staining was scored as follows: 0: no staining in any microscopic field, 1+: <30% of tissue stained positive, 2+: between 30% and 60% stained positive, and 3+: >60% stained positive. The minimum score, when summed (extension + intensity), was 0, and the maximum score was 6. For AKT1, a combined staining score (extension+ intensity) of ≤ 3 was considered negative (low staining), and that between 4 and 6 considered positive. For TP53 and CDKN1A, a combined staining score (extension+ intensity) of ≤ 4 was considered negative (low staining), and that between 5 and 6 considered positive.	Megavoltage photons (6 MV) were used to treat primary tumor and neck lymph nodes. Radiotherapy was administered five times a week at a dose of 2 Gy/d. The accumulated radiation dose to the primary tumor was 68 to 72 Gy, 60 to 62 Gy to the involved areas of the neck, and 50 Gy to uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy, specifically, DDP (100 mg/㎡) on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy, was administered to 39 patients.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Codon 72 (Arg/Pro), the most frequently studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of p53 to date, is associated with the ability of the gene to induce cell apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt pathway plays an essential role in the transcriptional activation function of p53, and is an important factor in radiotherapy resistance. The present study was designed to evaluate the prediction of response to radiotherapy based on p53 codon 72 SNP and pAkt expression in biopsy specimens of locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) before treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 75 consecutive patients with locoregional NPC were enrolled. The p53 codon 72 SNP was identified from retrospectively collected paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens using Sanger sequencing. Expression patterns of p53, p21, 14-3-3σ, and pAkt proteins were investigated using immunohistochemical analyses. The effects of genetic polymorphisms and protein expression on progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test. RESULTS: The p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro carriers showed lower risk of disease progression (local recurrence and distant metastases) (HR: 0.300; 95% CI: 0.092-0.983; p=0.047). However, this association between the p53 codon 72 polymorphism and PFS was not significant in the pAkt-positive subgroup. No association was observed between protein expression of p53, p21 or 14-3-3σ and p53 codon72 polymorphisms. Notably, positive expression of p53 protein appeared to be correlated with poorer PFS among patients diagnosed as local regional lymph node metastasis (N+) before treatment (p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro genotype may be an effective independent prognostic marker for better outcome in patients with locoregional NPC. Based on the current findings, we hypothesize that pAkt weakens the predictive value of p53 codon 72 SNP in NPC. A combination of positive p53 protein expression and local regional lymph node metastasis may additionally be predictive of high risk of disease progression.

17	The prognostic value of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p53 protein expression in patients with advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2006	16803719	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16803719	Journal Article	\N	45	36	10	\N	49.2000000000000028	[25.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with curative intent and received a radiation dose of approximately 7000 cGy in 35 fractions, five times a week.	Radiotherapy	5	CONCLUSION: p53 protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were not ideal prognostic indicators in advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Further investigation in searching for other potential biomarkers is needed to enhance the prediction of treatment outcome. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic significance of p53 protein and PCNA expression in patients with advanced NPC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 46 patients with advanced NPC who had received treatment and regular follow-up for at least 5 years. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to assess p53 protein expression and PCNA labeling index, and correlate them with pathological subtypes, TNM stage, the presence of locoregional recurrence, and 5-year survival rate. RESULTS: p53 nuclear staining was positive in 32 patients (69.6%). All cases had positive PCNA nuclear staining with labeling index (LI) ranging from 6.5% to 92.9% (mean 53.4%). Only advanced T stage was found to be associated with high PCNA LI. Overexpression of p53 and PCNA LI had no impact on 5-year survival in this study group.

18	High specificity of quantitative excision repair cross-complementing 1 messenger RNA expression for prediction of minor histopathological response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer	English	2004	15173087	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15173087	Journal Article	\N	36	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	Gene expression levels were described using the median as a point estimator and the range of values.	CDDP (20 mg/㎡/day) was administered as a short-term infusion on days 1-5, and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/㎡/day) was administered as a continuous infusion over 24 h on days 1-5. Radiation therapy was administered by linear accelerators with 10-15-MV photons. Radiation therapy was simulated to encompass the tumor volume with 5-cm cephalocaudal-margins and 2-cm radial margins, and treatment ports were designed to include enlarged regional nodes based on computed tomography evaluation and endoscopic ultrasound. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26) to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple field technique. Surgical resection was performed 4-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation after clinical restaging using the same procedures as for staging, except for laparoscopy. Standardized transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy and reconstruction by gastric tube interposition with either left cervical or high intrathoracic anastomosis was performed in all patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) gene is coding for a nucleotide excision repair protein involved in the repair of radiation- and chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. We examined the potential of quantitative ERCC1 mRNA expression to predict minor or major histopathological response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and 36 Gy of radiation) followed by transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (cT(2-4), N(x), M(0)). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tissue samples were collected by endoscopic biopsy before treatment. RNA was isolated from biopsies, and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assays were performed to determine ERCC1 mRNA expression. Relative mRNA levels (tumor/normal ratios) were calculated as (ERCC1/beta-actin in tumor)/(ERCC1/beta-actin in paired normal tissue). ERCC1 expression levels were correlated with the objective histopathological response in resected specimens. Histomorphological regression was defined as major response when resected specimens contained <10% of residual vital tumor cells or in case a pathologically complete response was achieved. RESULTS: Twelve of 36 tumors showed a major histopathological response, and 24 of 36 showed a minor histopathological response. Relative expression levels of ERCC1 of >1.09 were not associated with a major histopathological response (sensitivity, 62.5%; specificity, 100%) and 15 of 24 patients with minor histopathological response to the delivered neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy could be unequivocally identified. This association of dichotomized relative ERCC1 mRNA expression and histopathological response was statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Relative expression levels of ERCC1 mRNA determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR appear highly specific to predict minor response to our neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy protocol in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer and could be applied to prevent expensive, noneffective, and potentially harmful therapies in a substantial number (42%) of patients.

19	ERCC1 expression as a predictive marker of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation 	English	2008	18594541	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18594541	Journal Article	\N	45	37	8	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The median value of the H score was chosen as the cutoff point for separating low and high levels of ERCC1 expression.	The chemotherapy regimens comprised cisplatin with or with- out 5-fluorouracil or taxane. The radiation dose was 72 Gy over 7 weeks (2 Gy/day , 5 fractions per week). Pretreatment evaluation included the patient’s history, physical examination, performance status, chest X-ray, complete blood count, blood chemistry, and computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck. The response to CCRT was assessed according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Patients were evaluated by CT scan or MRI of the head and neck every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) enzyme plays a rate-limiting role in the nucleotide excision repair pathway and is associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of ERCC1 expression as a predictive marker of survival in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) treated with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). ERCC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The median age of the 45 patients analysed was 56 years (range 27-75 years), and 82% were men; 73% of all specimens showed high expression of ERCC1. The overall tumour response rate after CCRT was 89%. The median follow-up was 53.6 months (95% CI, 34.5-72.7 months). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 58.7 and 61.3%, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that patients with low expression of ERCC1 had a significantly higher 3-year PFS (83.3 vs 49.4%, P=0.036) and OS (91.7 vs 45.5%, P=0.013) rates. Multivariate analysis showed that low expression of ERCC1 was an independent predictor for prolonged survival (HR, 0.120; 95% CI, 0.016-0.934, P=0.043). These results suggest that ERCC1 expression might be a useful predictive marker of locally advanced SCCHN in patients treated with cisplatin-based CCRT.

20	Prognostic value of microvessel density and p53 expression on the locoregional metastasis and survival of the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2013	23343952	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23343952	Journal Article	\N	70	62	8	\N	56.3999999999999986	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Positive TP53-expression was deﬁned when there were >10% positive-stained neoplastic cells.	All patients underwent surgical resection with postoperative radiotherapy between 1997 and 2006, and were selected and treated by the same physician. Treatment of the patients consisted of standard radiotherapy using the conventional 2-dimensional technique delivered with megavoltage (cobalt-60 or 6 MV linear accelerator). Total doses ranged from 50 to 70 Gy in daily fractions of 2 Gy, 5 times a week.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Cancer cells need to develop microvessels in order to grow and to establish metastatic foci. A role for the p53 protein in the regulation of the angiogenic process is suggested. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between immunohistochemical expression of microvessel density (MVD), measured by CD31 staining, and p53 protein with clinicopathologic factors, and survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (n=70). Tumor angiogenesis was estimated by determining MVD in areas with the highest number of stained microvessels (hot spots). Clinicopathologic factors and immunohistochemical data were evaluated by χ statistical test and were submitted to binary logistic regression to analyze the risk of presence of lymph node metastasis. Factors that might predict survival were investigated using Cox proportional hazards tests. Differences were considered statistically significant when P<0.05. The percentage of p53-positive cells showed no association with clinicopathologic parameters and MVD. Patients with locoregional metastasis presented statistically significant higher MVD (P=0.043). Individuals presenting head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in posterior sites (P=0.022; OR=3.644) and higher MVD (P=0.039; OR=3.247) had a significant increase in risk of metastasis occurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that presence of lymph node metastasis was statistically significant for overall survival of head and neck carcinoma patients (P=0.006; OR =2.917). The present data suggest that MVD represents a promising diagnostic tool to identify individuals with increased risk for the development of metastatic disease, which is very indicative of poor prognosis.

21	Low SFRP1 Expression Correlates with Poor Prognosis and Promotes Cell Invasion by Activating the Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway in NPC	English	2015	26276746	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26276746	Journal Article	\N	244	183	61	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The cutoff values were as follows: low SFRP1 expression, staining index score 4; high SFRP1 expression, staining index score > 4.	All patients were treated with conventional 2-dimensional radiotherapy; patients with stage III-IV disease also received platinum-based concurrent chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Distant metastasis remains the predominant mode of treatment failure in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Unfortunately, the molecular events underlying NPC metastasis remain poorly understood. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. However, little is known about the function and mechanism of SFRP1 in NPC. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine SFRP1 expression levels in patients with NPC. SFRP1 function was evaluated using MTT, colony formation, wound-healing, Transwell assays, and in vivo models. The methylation level of SFRP1 in NPC cells was examined using bisulfate pyrosequencing; the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway genes were studied using Western blotting. Compared with patients with high SFRP1 expression, patients with low SFRP1 expression had worse overall survival [HR, 2.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-3.94; P = 0.002], disease-free survival (HR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.23-3.18; P = 0.005), and distant metastasis-free survival (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.19-3.59; P = 0.009). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that SFRP1 was an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, SFRP1 was significantly downregulated in NPC cell lines. SFRP1 overexpression suppressed NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and lung colonization in vivo. SFRP1 expression was restored after treatment with a demethylation agent, and the SFRP1 promoter region was hypermethylated in NPC cells. β-Catenin, c-Myc, and cyclin D1 were downregulated after SFRP1 restoration, which suggested that SFRP1 suppressed growth and metastasis by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in NPC. SFRP1 provides further insight into NPC progression and may provide novel therapeutic targets for NPC treatment.	Cancer Prevention Research	Stage I-II: 72 patients, Stage III-IV: 172 patients.
22	Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor and Her-2 are predictors of favorable outcome and reduced complete response rates, respectively, in patients with muscle-invading bladder cancers treated by concurrent radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy: a report from the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group	English	2005	15890569	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15890569	Journal Article	\N	73	53	20	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For TP53, RB1, and CDKN2A, cutpoints of 20% positive nuclear immunoreactivity were used.	Patients from four RTOG bladder studies: RTOG 8802, 8903, 9506, and 9706 were used in these analyses. RTOG 8802, 9506, and 9706 were Phase II studies looking at transurethral surgery plus induction with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation followed by either consolidation chemoradiotherapy or cystectomy based on initial response. In addition, RTOG 8802 had methotrexate, vinblastine, and cisplatin (MCV) as neoadjuvant chemotherapy, whereas RTOG 9706 used MCV as adjuvant chemotherapy. RTOG 8802, 8903, and 9706 used concurrent cisplatin and radiation for the induction and consolidation chemotherapy, while RTOG 9506 used cisplatin and 5-ﬂuorouracil concurrent with radiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Erb-1 (epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFR) and Erb-2 (Her-2) are two of the best characterized members in the EGFR pathway. In many tumor types, overexpression of these proteins is associated with enhanced malignant potential. Our objective in this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of EGFR and Her-2 expression in bladder cancer cases from four prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) bladder preservation trials using cisplatin-containing chemoradiation (RTOG 8802, 8903, 9506, and 9706). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tumors from 73 cases from patients with muscle-invading T2-T4a bladder cancers had slides interpretable for EGFR staining; 55 cases had slides interpretable for Her-2 staining. Additionally, the respective prognostic values of p53, pRB, and p16 immunostaining were concomitantly examined. Staining and interpretation of staining were done in a blinded manner, without knowledge of clinical outcome. Staining was judged as positive or negative. Subsequently, staining was correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, EGFR positivity was significantly associated with improved overall survival (p = 0.044); disease-specific survival (DSS) (p = 0.042); and DSS with intact bladder (p = 0.021). There was also a trend for association between EGFR expression and reduced frequency of distant metastasis (p = 0.06). On multivariate analysis adding tumor stage, tumor grade, whether a visibly complete transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) was done or not, and patient age to the model, EGFR positivity was significantly associated with improved DSS. On univariate analysis, Her-2 positivity was significantly associated with reduced complete response (CR) rates (50% vs. 81%, p = 0.026) after chemoradiation which remained significant on multivariate analysis. The other markers examined in this study were not found to have any prognostic value in this setting. CONCLUSION: Epidermal growth factor receptor expression appears to correlate significantly with improved outcome in bladder cancer, whereas Her-2 expression is significantly associated only with reduced CR rates after chemoradiation. Further investigations are warranted into how EGFR family members regulate response to chemoradiation in bladder cancer and their potential therapeutic implications.

23	MDM2 overexpression is associated with short survival in adults with medulloblastoma 	English	2002	11916503	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11916503	Journal Article	Caucasian	51	33	18	\N	32.5	[18.0,62.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Cases with less than 5% immunopositive tumor cells were scored as negative. Cases with 5% to 20% positive cells were scored as +; 21%-50% ++; more than 50% +++.	The patients received postoperative radiotherapy on the whole CNS, with a posterior fossa dose of 30 to 55 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	In adult medulloblastoma, postoperative radiotherapy is significantly effective in prolonging time to recurrence and survival time; however, the response of individual cases to radiotherapy, that is the total survival, is different. Apoptosis is an important cellular response to radiation. It can be hypothesized that the individual radiosensitivity of medulloblastomas depends on the individual capability to undergo apoptosis. p53 protein is involved in the apoptotic response to ionizing radiation; loss of function of p53 can be the consequence not only of TP53 mutations, but also of amplification and/or overexpression of the MDM2 gene. We have analyzed cerebellar medulloblastomas from 51 adults (>16 years of age) for MDM2 gene amplification (by differential polymerase chain reaction assay), TP53 gene mutation (by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 5-8), and immunohistochemical expression of p53 (clone DO1) and MDM2 (clone IF2). The results have been evaluated in relation to age, tumor location, classic or desmoplastic type, MIB-1 labeling index, and total survival. No tumor had MDM2 amplification. Ten tumors had MDM2 positive tumor cells. One case had a mutated TP53 gene; 16/51 cases had intense p53 immunostaining. Only 2 MDM2 protein-positive tumors were also p53-positive. Both subgroups of MDM2 - and p53-positive tumors had a significantly shorter postoperative survival. In conclusion, the overexpression of MDM2 protein and the accumulation of wild-type p53 are unrelated in adult medulloblastoma; they may result in a reduced apoptotic response after radiotherapy and contribute to a shortened survival. Also, MDM2 amplification and TP53 gene mutation are rare events in medulloblastomas of adults.	Neuro-Oncology	\N
229	Cyclooxygenase-2 expression in pretreatment biopsy as a predictor of tumor responses after preoperative chemoradiation in rectal cancer	English	2008	19015468	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19015468	Journal Article	\N	30	26	4	48	\N	[31.0,69.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Chemotherapy was administered intravenously and was composed of 425-mg/㎡ per day 5-fluorouracil and 20-mg/㎡/d leucovorin during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy. Radiation was administered using a 6-MV/10-MV dual-photon linear accelerator and a 4-filed box technique. The total radiation dosage was 5040 cGy divided across 25 fractions during 5 weeks. Thirteen patients underwent abdominoperineal resection, 8 underwent low anterior resection, 8 underwent ultralow anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis, and 1 underwent the Hartmann operation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens is a useful predictive marker of tumor response to preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in rectal cancer. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Colorectal cancer clinic. PATIENTS: Thirty patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were given preoperative CRT of 5040 cGy for 6 weeks with concurrent administration of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Immunohistochemical staining for COX-2 and angiogenesis markers (vascular endothelial growth factor, thymidine phosphorylase, and CD34) were performed on biopsy specimens obtained before preoperative CRT. The responses to preoperative CRT were assessed by radiologic downsizing (measured using magnetic resonance imaging volumetry), histopathologic downstaging, and a 3-point tumor regression grade (TRG) evaluation, based on the ratio of residual cancer to fibrosis. RESULTS: Tumor downstaging was seen in 15 patients (50.0%) and nodal downstaging was noted in 14 patients (46.7%). Tumor regression grade 1 (good response) was shown by 7 patients (23.3%); TRG2 (moderate response) in 15 patients (50.0%); and TRG3 (poor response) in 8 patients (26.7%). Patients with COX-2 overexpression were more likely to show a poor TRG (P = .003) and were less likely to achieve histopathologic nodal downstaging (P = .03) than those with normal COX-2 expression. Vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression was found to be associated with COX-2 overexpression (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of COX-2 in pretreatment biopsies might be predictive of poor tumor regression after preoperative CRT. Administration of COX-2 inhibitors to patients with COX-2 overexpression, in an attempt to improve response rate to preoperative CRT, warrants assessment in clinical trials.

24	Prognostic value of Mdm2, p53 and p16 in patients with astrocytomas	English	2004	15218947	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15218947	Journal Article	\N	21	\N	21	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	As there is no consensus about MDM2 threshold of positivity we raised it to 25%, due to the high staining observed.	Patients received postsurgery radiotherapy and chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Surgical cure of gliomas infiltrating into the brain is practically impossible and their clinical course is primarily determined by the biological behavior of the tumor cell. The purpose of this study was to analyze retrospectively prognostic input of p53, Mouse double minute-2 (Mdm2) and p16 in 103 uniformly treated patients with astrocytic tumors. The expression of these molecules was measured by immunohistochemical procedure. Prognostic evaluation was performed with the multivariate proportional hazards model. The follow-up period lasted 19 (5-122) months for the survivors. We observed that 66% of gliomas showed mutated p53, while only 17% overexpressed Mdm2, the p53-regulatory molecule. Besides, almost 50% of gliomas lost p16 immunopositivity. Only p53 labeling showed a positive correlation with the grade of malignancy, according with the WHO classification. The association between mutated p53 and histological grade remained when prognostic variables were considered in a multivariate analysis. No association between p53 status and overall survival was found. On the other hand, Mdm2 overexpression and, unexpectedly, p16 immunopositivity were associated with a shorter survival in an univariate analysis. However, Cox-regression analysis showed that only Mdm2 in female patients was an independent prognostic factor, associated with shorter survival. In conclusion, our results suggest that Mdm2 could be a relevant marker in determining the evolution of glioma patients and could provide a more objective way to classify astrocytomas.

25	Murine double minute 2 predicts response of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to definitive chemoradiotherapy 	English	2015	25880782	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880782	Journal Article	\N	79	68	11	\N	63.2999999999999972	[43.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	When determining the cut-off values, we identified the values for abnormal expression as follows: TP53 ≥ 10% and CDKN2A < 5%.	This protocol consisted of the following components: (1) 2 cycles of an intravenous cisplatin infusion (40 mg/㎡) on days 1 and 8, (2) a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (400 mg/㎡) over 24 hours on days 1-5 and 8-12 every 5 weeks, and (3) concurrent radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions over a period of 8 weeks including a 2-week remission following the administration of 30 Gy). Salvage esophagectomy for patients with persistent or recurrent disease was performed to improve outcomes as soon as persistent or recurrent disease was confirmed, if we could obtain the informed consent from the patients and the patients were fit for the surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) has recently become one of the most effective therapies for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, it is also true this treatment has not been effective in all patients. Therefore, it is very important to evaluate the surrogate marker of dCRT in order to improve clinical outcomes of patients with ESCC. On the other hand, our previous study had suggested that murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and p16 were associated with chemoradioresistance in ESCC. METHODS: We selected pretreatment biopsy specimens of ESCC patients from our prospective clinical study on dCRT. Seventy-nine cases histologically diagnosed as ESCC were used. We immunohistochemically investigated these specimens using antibodies against MDM2, p53, p16, and Ki-67. RESULTS: The patients included 68 males and 11 females with a mean age of 63.3 years. The number of patients in each clinical stage was as follows: 22 in c-Stage I; 17 in c-Stage II; and 40 in c-Stage III. cT, cN, and cStage were significantly more advanced in the Failure group (including patients with persistent and recurrent disease after dCRT) than in the complete response (CR) group (patients with persistent CR after dCRT). The clinical stage inversely correlated with the CR rate and the rescue rate after failure. The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the patients with advanced cT, cN, and cStage levels, and in the Failure group. MDM2 positivity was significantly higher in the Failure group than in the CR group in cStageIII (P = 0.014). The number of patients with an absence of p16 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in the Failure group than in the CR group in cStageIII (P = 0.010) but not in cStageI or cStageII. Moreover, the overall survival with a Ki-67 ≥ 33.7% was significantly better than that with <33.7% for patients in cStageIII (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggested that MDM2 and p16 are predictive markers for chemoradioresistance in cStageIII ESCC and Ki-67 is a prognostic marker following dCRT in cStageIII ESCC. These issues could contribute to the formulation of treatment strategy for patients with advanced ESCC.	BMC Cancer	Stage I: 22 patients, Stage II: 17 patients, Stage III: 40 patients.
26	MDM2 as a predictor of prostate carcinoma outcome: an analysis of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 8610	English	2005	16007688	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16007688	Journal Article	\N	108	108	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For the manual analysis, 5% dark brown nuclear tumor cell staining was considered positive, indicating overexpression of MDM2. TP53 was deemed positive when >20% of the tumor cells had nuclear staining, as quantiﬁed manually.	Sixty-two and 46 patients were assigned to radiotherapy alone and radiotherapy + short-term androgen deprivation, respectively.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: The MDM2 oncoprotein promotes p53 degradation via ubiquitin, establishing negative feedback control of p53 and consequently affecting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The authors evaluated the association between MDM2 expression and local failure, distant metastasis (DM), cause-specific mortality, and overall mortality in men treated in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 8610 with radiotherapy, with or without androgen deprivation. METHODS: Of the 456 eligible and analyzable patients (parent cohort), adequate archival diagnostic tissue specimens from 108 patients were available for MDM2 analysis (MDM2 cohort). Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis (MVA) was used to determine the relation of MDM2 to the endpoints. MDM2 overexpression was manually classified as > 5% nuclear staining. An image analysis system was also used to quantify the proportion of tumor nuclei with MDM2 staining (ACIS index) and staining intensity. RESULTS: Overexpression of MDM2 by manual counts was seen in 44% (n = 47) of the patients. In the manual count analysis, there was no significant relation between MDM2 overexpression and outcome. The ACIS index, using a cutoff point defined by the median value, < or = 3% versus > 3%, was related to 5-year DM rates in univariate analyses (32.6% vs. 45.8%; P = 0.057) and MVA (P = 0.06). The intensity of MDM2 staining was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: MDM2 expression quantified by image analysis was weakly associated with DM. The cohort examined was relatively small and with larger patient numbers, MDM2 overexpression may emerge as a more significant covariate.	Cancer	T2: 29 patients, T3: 79 patients.
27	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer induces changes in the expression of nuclear β-catenin: prognostic significance	English	2014	24629143	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24629143	Journal Article	\N	98	72	26	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The expression was categorised as follows: absent (0% of cells); low (less than 25% of cells); moderate (between 25% and 75% of cells) or high (more than 75% of cells). For analytical purposes, the variable was dichotomised as low CTNNB1 expression (less than 25% of cells) and high CTNNB1 expression (25-100%). CDH1 expression in the membrane was evaluated based on the percentage of tumour cells that expressed CDH1. The expression was categorised as follows: absence (no expression); low (less than 25% of cells); moderate (between 25% and 75% of cells) or high (more than 75% of cells). CDH1 expression was dichotomised based on absence (no expression) or presence (low, moderate and high expression).	All patients were treated according to the routine protocol with pelvic radiotherapy (46-50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) intravenous infusion (225 mg/㎡ ) or capecitabine (825 mg/㎡ ) during radiotherapy treatment, followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) 6 weeks after chemoradiotherapy treatment. After surgery, patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU: 4 cycles of 500 mg/㎡ once a day for 5 days repeated every 21 days, or capecitabine: 4 cycles of 1250 mg/㎡ every 12 h for 14 days).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the cornerstone of treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Although high local control is achieved, overall rates of distant control remain suboptimal. Colorectal carcinogenesis is associated with critical alterations of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway involved in proliferation and survival. The aim of this study was to assess whether CRT induces changes in the expression of β-catenin/E-cadherin, and to determine whether these changes are associated with survival. METHODS: The Immunohistochemical expression of nuclear β-catenin and membranous E-cadherin was prospectively analysed in tumour blocks from 98 stage II/III rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative CRT. Tumour samples were collected before and after CRT treatment. All patients were treated with pelvic RT (46-50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) intravenous infusion (225 mg/m2) or capecitabine (825 mg/m2) during RT treatment, followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). Disease-free survival (DFS) was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method and a multivariate Cox regression model was employed for the Multivariate analysis. RESULTS: CRT induced significant changes in the expression of nuclear β-catenin (49% of patients presented an increased expression after CRT, 17% a decreased expression and 34% no changes; p = 0.001). After a median follow-up of 25 months, patients that overexpressed nuclear β-catenin after CRT showed poor survival compared with patients that experienced a decrease in nuclear β-catenin expression (3-year DFS 92% vs. 43%, HR 0.17; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.8; p = 0.02). In the multivariate analysis for DFS, increased nuclear β-catenin expression after CRT almost reached the cut-off for significance (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, preoperative CRT for LARC induced significant changes in nuclear β-catenin expression, which had a major impact on survival. Finding a way to decrease CRT resistance would significantly improve LARC patient survival.	BMC Cancer	T2-3: 80 patients, T4: 18 patients; N-: 43 patients, N+:  55 patients.
32	Pretreatment CD133 and Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression as the Predictive Markers of the Pathological Effect of Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer Patients	English	2011	21825889	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825889	Journal Article	\N	96	66	30	62	\N	[37.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The results were immunopositive for PROM1 if ≥5% tumor cells exhibited positive apical/endoluminal surface staining; for TP53, PSMD9, and CDKN1A if ≥10%, ≥50%, ≥10% of the tumor cells showed positive nuclear staining; and for EGFR if >0% cells had mem- branous staining, based on previous reports. For PTGS2 scoring, both the distribution and the intensity of staining were semiquantitatively assessed. The intensity of staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium), and 3 (strong). The distribution of staining was scored as 0 (0%), 1 (1%-25%), 2 (26%-50%), 3 (51%-75%), and 4 (76%- 100%). The sum of the intensity and distribution score was used as the final staining score (0-7) for PTGS2. Tumors with a final score of ≥3 were considered positive.	All patients underwent short-term preoperative chemoradiotherapy (20 Gy given in 5 daily doses of 4 Gy and administration of Tegafur/Uracil 400 mg/day for 7 days from the beginning to the end of irradiation) followed by total mesorectal excision.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: CD133 confers chemoradioresistance properties to cells and has recently been used to identify cancer-initiating cells. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the overexpression of CD133 and cyclooxygenase-2 can be used as predictive markers of tumor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer. SETTING: The study was conducted at the National Defense Medical College Hospital in Japan. PATIENTS: We recruited 96 patients who underwent a single regimen of preoperative short-term chemoradiotherapy (20 Gy in 5 fractions with 400 mg/day Tegafur/Uracil for 1 week) and radical resection. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study. We obtained pretreatment biopsy specimens of these patients and immunostained these specimens with antibodies for CD133, cyclooxygenase-2, p53, p27, p21, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The resected primary tumor was evaluated according to 2 different tumor regression grading systems that were based on the degrees of fibrosis and cytological alterations. RESULTS: Positivity for CD133 or cyclooxygenase-2 expression was associated with chemoradioresistance, which was determined by the degree of fibrosis, in both univariate (P = .02 and P = .0003) and multivariate (P = .03 and P = .001) analyses. Univariate and multivariate analyses of the degree of cytological alterations also revealed a significant association between chemoradioresistance and the expression of CD133 (P = .005 and P = .003) and cyclooxygenase-2 (P = .005 and P = .03), whereas other markers failed to associate. LIMITATIONS: The information on patients' outcome was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed the independent predictive values of CD133 and cyclooxygenase-2 expressions in histological tumor regression after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

The VEGFA over-expression was defined as more than 10% tumor cells with positive staining, whereas VEGFA low-expression was less than 10%.	All patients were treated with standard curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common malignancies in southern China. The China 1992 TNM staging system has been widely used for prognosis prediction of NPC patients in China. Although NPC patients can be classified according to their clinical stage in this system, their prognosis may vary significantly. METHOD: 280 cases of NPC with clinical follow-up data were collected and expressions of survivin and VEGF in tumor tissues were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Apoptosis index (AI) in 100 cases of NPC was detected by the TUNEL method. RESULTS: Expression of survivin and VEGF were significantly associated with TNM stage, T-stage and metastasis of NPC. The patients with survivin and VEGF over-expression presented lower 5-year survival rate, as compared to those of low-expression (42.32% vs. 70.54%, 40.1% vs. 67.8%, respectively, P < 0.05), especially in advanced stage patients (36.51% vs. 73.41%, 35.03% vs. 65.22%, respectively, P < 0.05). The 5-year survival rate in NPC patients with survivin and VEGF dual over-expression was significantly lower than that of patients with dual low-expression (18.22% vs. 73.54%, respectively; P = 0.0003). Multivariate analysis indicated that both survivin and VEGF over-expression in NPC tumor tissues were strong independent factors of poor prognosis in NPC patients. The mean AI in the 39 survivin low-expression cases was 144.7 +/- 39.9, which was significantly higher than that in 61 survivin over-expression cases (111.6 +/- 39.8) (T test, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Survivin and VEGF over-expression are independent prognostic factors for the patients with NPC. These results also suggest that tumor survivin and VEGF expressions are valuable prognostic markers for prognosis prediction in NPC patients.	Journal of Translational Medicine	\N

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy is one of the standard therapeutic regimens for rectal carcinoma. Nevertheless, chemoradiation therapy is not completely devoid of adverse effects, and it would be interesting to try to predict which patient will respond to neoadjuvancy. This study aimed at analyzing factors influencing pathological response after therapy. We reviewed the clinical and morphological data of 39 patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy. We performed immunohistochemistry for p53, cyclin D1, MIB-1 (Ki67), and bcl-2 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue. In our series, 12 patients did not respond to neoadjuvant therapy, 12 showed a complete response, and 15 a partial response. There was a statistically significant association between response and cardiomyopathy (p=0.02) and tenesmus (p=0.02) and a trend towards significance for age (p=0.08), preoperative TNM (p=0.08), peritumoral inflammatory response (p=0.07), and preoperative CEA (p=0.08). As for immunohistochemistry, we only found a trend towards significance for cyclin D1 (p=0.08). In our series of patients with rectal carcinoma receiving preoperative chemoradiation therapy, few factors were predictive of a histological response. The histological response seems to improve survival and reduce relapses.	Pathology - Research and Practice	Stage I-II: 21 patients, Stage III-IV: 16 patients.

Tumors were scored as BCL2-negative if all or most of the malignant cells were unstained (<10% BCL2-positive) and as BCL2-positive if  >10% were immunostained.	All patients received a total dose of 50.40 Gy (according to ICRU 50 report) with daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on five consecutive days per weeks. During the first (Day 1-5) and fifth week (Days 29-33) of radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was delivered concomitantly at a dose of 1000 mg/㎡/day (maximum 1800 mg) as a 120-h continuous infusion. In 7 patients with large T4 tumors, oxaliplatin (20 mg/㎡/day, administered as 2-h infusion on Day 1-5 and 29-33) was added to the 5-FU regimen to improve downsizing. Six weeks after completion of preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT), patients were scheduled to undergo surgery. The median interval between completion of RCT and surgery for the 44 patients was 40 days (range: 35-54 days). Disease-free resection margins of the primary tumor were accomplished in 43 patients (1 patient with microscopic residual disease).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Tumor shrinkage by preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT) can markedly improve surgery in locally advanced (T4) rectal cancer with clear resection margins and may enable sphincter preservation in low-lying tumors. However, tumor response varies considerably, even among tumors treated according to the same protocol. If one is able to identify patients with highly radio-responsive tumors at the time of diagnosis, a selective and individualized policy of preoperative RCT might be pursued. METHODS: The apoptotic index (AI), Ki-67, p53, and bcl-2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on pretreatment biopsies from 44 patients treated uniformly according to a prospective neoadjuvant RCT protocol (CAO/AIO/ARO-94). Treatment response was assessed histopathologically in the resected surgical specimen, using a five-point grading system. Expression of each marker was correlated with tumor response and relapse-free survival after curative surgery. RESULTS: Tumors with complete (n = 3) or good (n = 28) response to RCT showed significantly higher pretreatment levels of apoptosis (mean AI: 2.06%) than tumors with moderate (n = 7), minimal (n = 5), or no regression (n = 1) from RCT (AI: 1.44%, p = 0.003). The AI was significantly related to Ki-67 (p = 0.05), but not to p53 and bcl-2 status. Tumor regression and AI best predicted relapse-free survival after combined modality treatment and curative surgery. CONCLUSION: Spontaneous apoptosis in rectal cancer may serve as an important predictor of tumor regression from RCT in rectal cancer and as a significant prognosticator of relapse-free survival. Thus, this molecular marker may finally help to tailor therapy with regard to (neo-) adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer.

31	p53 status and response to radiotherapy in rectal cancer: a prospective multilevel analysis	English	2005	15956964	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15956964	Journal Article	\N	70	43	27	65	\N	[39.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For each series of IHC analysis, a negative and a positive TP53 control slide was included. A specimen was scored positive when more than 5% of the tumour cells showed nuclear staining with at least one of the anti-TP53 antibodies (Pab 1801 or DO7).	For radiotherapy, patients were treated in the supine position with a three-field isocentric technique using 18 MV photon beams daily, five times a week. The daily dose at the isocenter (in accordance with ICRU 62) was 1.8 Gy; the total dose to the entire pelvis was 45 Gy. In 29 patients, the primary tumor received a boost dose of up to 15 Gy, because a clinical response was observed during the conventional course of treatment. Four patients received concurrent radiochemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and intravenous (i.v.) leucovorin beginning on the first day of radiation therapy. One patient received two cycles of 400 mg/㎡/day of 5-FU with 10 mg/㎡ of leucovorin (days 1-5 and 29-33 of radiation therapy). Three patients received three 48-h courses of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/day ) with 100 mg/㎡/day of leucovorin (days 1-2, 15-16, and 29-30 of radiation therapy). The median time between the first day of radiotherapy and surgery was 10 weeks (73.9 weeks).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective study, the predictive role of p53 status analysed at four different levels in identifying the response to preoperative radiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma. Before treatment, 70 patients were staged and endoscopic forceps biopsies from the tumour area were taken. p53 status was assessed by total cDNA sequencing, allelic loss analysis, immunohistochemistry, and p53 antibodies. Neoadjuvant treatment was based on preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy. Response to therapy was evaluated after surgery by both pathologic downstaging and histologic tumour regression grade. In all, 35 patients (50.0%) had p53 gene mutations; 44.4% of patients had an allelic loss; nuclear p53 overexpression was observed in 39 patients (55.7%); and p53 antibodies were detected in 11 patients (16.7%). In the multilevel analysis of p53 status, gene mutations correlated with both nuclear protein overexpression (P < 0.0001) and loss of heterozygosity (P = 0.013). In all, 29 patients (41.4%) were downstaged by pathologic analysis, and 19 patients (29.2%) were classified as tumour regression grade 1. Whatever the method of evaluation of treatment response, no correlation between p53 alterations and response to radiotherapy was observed. Our results do not support the use of p53 alterations alone as a predictive marker for response to radiotherapy in rectal carcinoma.

37	Prognostic value of Smac expression in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy	English	2012	21264534	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21264534	Journal Article	\N	98	57	41	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For DIABLO, positive staining was deﬁned as the plasma stained to be light yellow or pale brown in slice. According to the percentage of positive cells, positive cells <5% were defined negative, positive cells 10-30% weakly positive, positive cell >30% strong positive.	Preoperative radiotherapy was delivered in fractions of 2 Gy to reach a dose of 40 Gy, 5 fractions per week. All patients received a concurrent chemotherapy (300 mg/㎡ 5-FU, and 40 mg leucovorin) in the five first and five last days of radiotherapy. All patients received a total mesorectal excision (TME) procedure after a long interval of 4-6 weeks. Techniques of surgery were standardized using TME; a quality assurance of surgery by the pathologist was implemented. Four cycles of bolus fluorouracil (500 mg/㎡ /d five times weekly, repeated every 4 weeks) were started 4 weeks after surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The objective was to evaluate expression of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) expression before and after treatment in patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer and to correlate the clinicopathological characteristics and level of Smac expression with pathologic response and outcome. Expression of biomarker was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor samples from 98 patients with clinical Stage II and III rectal cancer treated with preoperative pelvic radiotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy. All patients received a standardized total mesorectal excision procedure after a long interval of 4-6 weeks. For Smac, patients with a good response to neoadjuvant CRT tended to have higher pre-therapy levels (P = 0.007). The level of Smac expression decreased after neoadjuvant therapy (P = 0.016). High expression of Smac before CRT, and high Dworak's tumor regression grade (TRG) were significantly associated with improved 5-year disease-free survival (P < 0.05). Pretreatment nodal status also was significantly associated with 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year local relapse-free survival (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis confirmed that the pretreatment expression of Smac and Lymph nodal status were independent prognostic factors. Our study suggests that high expression of Smac before neoadjuvant CRT could predict good outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer patients.	Medical Oncology	T3: 42 patients, T4: 56 patients.

All patients u went CT simulation for 3-dimensional conformal planning, and the 3-field treatment plan used a 6-MV photon posterior-anterior field and 15-MV photon-opposed lateral beams. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered to all patients in the form of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (2 cycles of an intravenous bolus injection of 5-FU, 400 mg/㎡ per day, and leucovorin, 20 mg/㎡ per day, for 3 days during the first and fifth weeks of radiotherapy). Patients underwent radical proctectomy after a median of 6 (range, 4-8) weeks from the completion of preoperative chemoradiotherapy. All the patients underwent surgery regardless of radiological response, which was not routinely performed. Standard surgery, including total mesorectal excision, was performed in all patients after an interval of approximately 6 weeks after completion of treatment. Further adjuvant treatment after surgery was left to the discretion of the treating physician. Only 18 of the 57 patients (32%) received in addition 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has become a standard treatment modality for locally advanced rectal cancer. Favorable long-term outcomes have been reported for patients with good responses to chemoradiotherapy. Therefore, predictive factors for chemoradiotherapy responses can be useful for their applicability to risk-adaptive therapy in patients with colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2, a key enzyme in ketogenesis, is associated with the responses of colorectal cancer cells to chemoradiotherapy. DESIGN: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 was identified by a 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis -based proteome analysis. It was analyzed in 12 colorectal cancer cells for associations with radiation or 5-fluorouracil susceptibility by Western blotting, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide assay, and small interfering RNA transfection. Then, tumor tissues obtained from 45 patients with rectal cancer before chemoradiotherapy were analyzed by Western blotting for associations with chemoradiotherapy responses. RESULTS: Expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 was significantly correlated with intrinsic radiation resistance of 12 cancer cells. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 expression was significantly affected by treatment with either 5-fluorouracil or radiation depending on cell types. The artificial suppression of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 did not result in the change of chemoradiation susceptibility in colorectal cancer cells. Nevertheless, in multivariate analyses, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 expression in rectal cancer tissues was shown to be a significant predictive factor for chemoradiotherapy responses, as evaluated in terms of tumor regression grade and downstaging. LIMITATIONS: Overall findings in vitro showed that the expression level of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 was highly variable depending on colon cancer cell types, and it cannot directly affect on chemoradiotherapy responses. The molecular mechanism underpinning the association between hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase expression and chemoradiotherapy responses needs to be elucidated through future research. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 was associated with the effects of chemoradiotherapy on human colorectal cancer cells. Pretreatment levels of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 2 in rectal cancer may be useful in predicting the responses to chemoradiotherapy.

34	Biological predictive factors in rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy	English	2008	18087284	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18087284	Journal Article	\N	57	32	25	66	\N	[33.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Immunostaining for MSH2 and MLH1 was estimated on a semiquantitative score according to the number of positive tumor cells as follows: 0% (0), <10% (1),10-50% (2), 51-80% (3) or 480% (4). The intensity of staining was also evaluated as weak (1+), moderate (2+) or strong (3+).For each tumor case, the values for the two variables were multiplied, resulting in a score ranging from 0 to 12. The 0-6 scores were considered as altered expression and 7-12, as preserved expression. VEGFA staining was considered positive in the tumour cell cytoplasm; immunoreactivity was graded as follows: positive, more than 10% of carcinoma cells stained, and negative less than 10% of carcinoma cells stained. For the evaluation of TP53 and CDKN1A waf expression, immunostaining were classified into two groups, corresponding to the percentage of nuclear staining: negative expression (less than 10% positive tumour cells) and positive expression (more than 10% positive tumour cells). TYMS expression was quantitated using a visual grading system based on the intensity of staining and was classified into groups from 0 to 3, where 0 and 1 were defined as low intensity, and 2 and 3 were defined as high intensity staining.	Thirty-eight patients were treated with preoperative radiotherapy alone by using high energy Linac (total dose 40 Gy specified to the isocentre, 250 cGy/day , four fractions per week), delivered in 16 fractions, to include the true pelvis (rectal volume, perirectal, presacral and iliac nodes) with the three-field technique and shaped portals. Another 19 patients were treated within a phase II trial with preoperative radiation (total dose 45 Gy to the isocentre, 180 cGy/day, with the three-field technique and shaped portals to cover the rectal volume and the perirectal, presacral and the internal iliac lymph nodes) and concurrent continuous infusion 5-FU (5-fluorouracil) at a daily dose of 200 mg/㎡ and weekly oxaliplatin 60 mg/㎡ for 5 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	We analysed the expression of microsatellite instability, p53, p21, vascular endothelial growth factor and thymidylate synthase (TS) in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 57 locally advanced rectal cancers. The aim of the study was to correlate the expression of these markers with pathological response. Nineteen patients were treated with preoperative concomitant radiotherapy (RT) and fluorouracil/oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (RCT), while 38 had RT alone. Pathological complete remission (pCR) and microfoci residual tumour (micR) occurred more frequently in patients treated with RCT (P=0.002) and in N0 tumours (P=0.004). Among patients treated with RCT, high TS levels were associated with a higher response rate (pCR+micR; P=0.015). No such correlation was found in the RT group. The other molecular factors were of no predictive value. Multivariate analysis confirmed a significant interaction between nodal status and the probability of achieving a pathological response (P=0.023) and between TS expression and treatment, indicating that a high TS level is predictive of a higher pathological response in the RCT subset (P=0.007). This study shows that lymph node status is the most important predictive factor of tumour response to preoperative treatment. Thymidylate synthase expression assessed immunohistochemically from pretreatment tumour biopsies may be a useful predictive marker of rectal tumour response to preoperative RCT.

35	Combined analysis of VEGF and EGFR predicts complete tumour response in rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy	English	2008	18182986	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18182986	Journal Article	\N	110	74	36	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	ROC Cut-off scores were determined to be 50% for TP53, 20% for VEGFA, BCL2 and EGFR and 10% for APAF1.	A daily fraction of 6.5 Gy was administered over four consecutive days up to a total of 26 Gy. Patients underwent surgery 4-8 weeks after brachytherapy as planned before treatment regardless of tumor response.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The ability to predict complete pathologic response or sensitivity to radiation before treatment would have a significant impact on the selection of patients for preoperative radiotherapy or chemo-radiation therapy schedules. The aim of this study was to determine the value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), p53, Bcl-2 and apoptosis protease-activating factor-1 (APAF-1) as predictors of complete pathologic tumour regression in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer. Pretreatment tumour biopsies from predominantly cT3 patients undergoing a preoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy protocol were immunostained for EGFR, VEGF, p53, Bcl-2 and APAF-1. Immunoreactivity was evaluated by three pathologists. Cut-off scores for tumour marker positivity were obtained by receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The association of marker expression with complete pathologic response was analysed in univariate and multivariable analysis. Multi-marker phenotypes of the independent protein markers were evaluated. In multivariable analysis, loss of VEGF (P-value=0.009; odds ratio (OR) (95% CI)=0.24 (0.08-0.69)) and positive EGFR (P-value=0.01; OR (95% CI)=3.82 (1.37-10.6)) both demonstrated independent predictive value for complete pathologic response. The odds of complete response were 12.8 for the multi-marker combination of VEGF-negative and EGFR-positive tumours. Of the 34 EGFR-negative- and VEGF-positive cases, 32 (94.1%) had no complete pathologic response. The combined analysis of VEGF and EGFR is predictive of complete pathologic response in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy. In addition, the findings of this study have identified a subgroup of simultaneous EGFR-negative and VEGF-positive patients who are highly resistant to radiotherapy and should perhaps be considered candidates for innovative neoadjuvant combined modalities.

Intensity (I) and distribution (D) of the staining were scored on a scale of 1 to 4. Tumors with I×D scores less than or equal to 4 represented as weak, while those with I×D greater than 4 represented as strong staining. For TP53, a semiquantitative grading was used, and tumors with no or <10% TP53 immunoreactions were classified as negative.	Patients with stage II or III rectal carcinoma in mid- or lower rectum were treated with 6-MV photons by a 4-field pelvis technique. The fields extended from L5/S1 level superiorly to the bottom of obturator foramina inferiorly, with a 1 to 1.5 cm margin on the bony pelvic inlet. All patients received preoperative radiotherapy (1.8 Gy per day, 5 days per week to give a total 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks for a total of 4,500 cGy) with concurrent chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 225 mg/㎡/day infusion for 5 days/week during a period of 5 weeks). Surgical resection with curative intent was undertaken 8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy. Thirty-five (94.6%) patients with stage II and III underwent potentially curative surgery, such as resection of all macroscopic tumors without positive margin and removal of the draining lymph nodes, and no evidence of distant metastases was observed. Patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 400 mg/㎡/day IV bolus + leucoverin 200 mg/㎡/day IV over 2 h then 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/㎡/day 22 h infusion for 2 days; every 2 weeks, repeated for 12 cycles).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The ability to predict response to chemoradiotherapy before the treatment may allow protecting poorly responding patients from the side effects of neoadjuvant treatment. Several molecular markers have been proposed to radio and chemosensitivity of rectal cancer. In this study, from pre-irradiation tumor biopsies, a novel and promising candidate factor survivin, and p53 and Ki-67 were assessed as predictors of response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of each marker was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on pretreatment biopsies from 37 patients having rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and curative surgery. Treatment response was assessed histopathologically in the resected surgical specimen. RESULTS: There was no correlation between expression of p53, Ki-67, and survivin with response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that these molecular markers are not helpful to identify patients who would have benefit from neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. Further investigations are necessary to select patients for preoperative treatment based on analysis of the preoperative biopsies.

43	Role of peroxiredoxin I in rectal cancer and related to p53 status	English	2010	20732753	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20732753	Journal Article	\N	120	\N	\N	\N	\N	[30.3,86.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The criterion for positive IHC scoring was specimens with >20% positive-staining tumor cells. Using this criterion, our IHC data for PRDX1 and TP53 staining in rectal cancer were stratified as positive and negative.	All patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by surgery according to the guidelines proposed by the colorectal cancer oncology team. We used the RT (radiotherapy) regimen to divide the 120 rectal cancer patients into group 1 (long-course RT, n = 58; RT 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions as neoadjuvant treatment) and group 2 (short-course RT, n = 62; RT 25 Gy in five fractions as neoadjuvant treatment).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is widely accepted for the treatment of localized rectal cancer. Although peroxiredoxin I (PrxI) and p53 have been implicated in carcinogenesis and cancer treatment, the role of PrxI and its interaction with p53 in the prognosis and treatment response of rectal cancer remain relatively unstudied. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In the present study, we examined the levels of PrxI and p53 in rectal cancer patients using membrane arrays and compared them with normal population samples. To demonstrate the biologic changes after manipulation of PrxI expression, we established stable transfectants of HCT-116 (wild-type p53) and HT-29 (mutant p53) cells with a PrxI silencing vector. The predictive capacities of PrxI and p53 were also assessed by relating the immunohistochemical staining of a retrospective series of rectal cancer cases to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: The membrane array and immunochemical staining data showed that PrxI, but not p53, was significantly associated with the tumor burden. Our immunochemistry findings further indicated that PrxI positivity was linked to a poor response to neoadjuvant therapy and worse survival. In cellular and animal experiments, the inhibition of PrxI significantly decreased tumor growth and sensitized the tumor to irradiation, as indicated by a lower capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species and more extensive DNA damage. The p53 status might have contributed to the difference between HCT-116 and HT-29 after knockdown of PrxI. CONCLUSION: According to our data, the level of PrxI combined with the p53 status is relevant to the prognosis and the treatment response. We suggested that PrxI might be a new biomarker for rectal cancer.	International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics	Stage I-II: 46 patients, Stage III: 74 patients.

Tumors were therefore regarded as SLC2A1 positive if there was any evidence of membranous SLC2A1 staining.	The treatment regimen consisted of a radiation dose of 46-54 Gy delivered in 28 fractions over 5 weeks. During Week 1 and 5 of radiotherapy 5-fluorouracil was administered as a continuous 120-hr infusion at a dose of 1,000 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days. Surgical resection was undertaken 4-6 weeks following completion of chemoradiotherapy as is standard practice.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy is used in locally advanced rectal cancer to reduce local recurrence and improve operability, however a proportion of tumors do not undergo significant regression. Identification of predictive markers of response to chemoradiotherapy would improve patient selection and may allow response modification by targeting of specific pathways. The aim of this study was to determine whether expression of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and p53 in pretreatment rectal cancer biopsies was predictive of tumor response to chemoradiotherapy. Immunohistochemical staining for GLUT-1 and p53 was performed on 69 pretreatment biopsies and compared to tumor response in the resected specimen as determined by the tumor regression grade (TRG) scoring system. GLUT-1 expression was significantly associated with reduced response to chemoradiotherapy and increasing GLUT expression correlated with poorer response (p=0.02). GLUT-1 negative tumors had a 70% probability of good response (TRG3/4) compared to a 31% probability of good response in GLUT-1 positive tumors. GLUT-1 may be a useful predictive marker of response to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer.

To simplify statistical analysis, however, these were reduced to three groups: negative (none or < 10%), medium positive (10-50%) or high positive (> 50%).	Preoperative chemoradiation was offered to all patients after explaining the goals and risks of neoadjuvant vs a more selective adjuvant treatment. Thirty-three patients (group I) preferred to undergo immediate surgery followed by adjuvant chemoradiation when indicated, while 34 (group II) accepted preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Eventually all patients were operated on undergoing a curative total mesorectal excision. Patients in group II were operated on 6-9 weeks after the completion of treatment. Patients in group I with positive lymph nodes received adjuvant chemoradiation. Preoperative chemoradiation therapy fields included the primary tumour, the adjacent lymph node drainage area in the pelvis and the regional nodes along the superior haemorrhoidal vessels. The tumour dose was 45 Gy delivered in 25 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy. Chemotherapy consisted of fluorouracil (5-FU, 375 mg/㎡ bolus daily for 5 days) and leucovorin (LV, 10 mg/㎡ daily for 5 days). These were administered concurrently during the first 5 days and on days 29-33 of radiation therapy. Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation was started 4-6 weeks after surgery with chemotherapy given for two cycles every 28 days in the same dosage as above. After two cycles of 5-FU plus LV, radiotherapy was initiated in daily fractions of 2 Gy over 5 weeks to a total dose of 54 Gy. All patients with positive nodes in groups I and II were planned to receive four extra cycles of postoperative chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: The expression of pro-apoptotic (Bax) and anti-apoptotic (mutated p53, Bcl-2, Bclxl) proteins was determined retrospectively using immunohistochemistry in pre-treatment biopsy samples from patients with rectal cancer treated with or without preoperative chemoradiation to investigate their role as prognostic markers and indicators of radiochemosensitivity. METHOD: Biopsy samples from 67 patients operated for stage II/III rectal cancer and enrolled in an active follow-up programme were examined 8-10 years after surgery. Thirty-three had been treated with immediate surgery followed, in selected cases, by adjuvant postoperative chemoradiation. Thirty-four had preoperative chemoradiation. Immunohistochemical staining was carried out using an automated immunostainer on sections of paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: Independent prognostic factors for rectal cancer death were pN status (hazard ratio 3.82; 95% CI 1.67-8.73) and a high level of Bclxl positivity (hazard ratio 4.75; 95% CI 2.10-10.72) according to multivariate regression analysis by stepwise selection. Bax expression was associated with downstaging and higher survival in irradiated patients (P = 0.0004). CONCLUSION: Pretreatment evaluation of apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bclxl factors in biopsy samples of stage II/III rectal cancers may be helpful in selecting tumours that will respond to chemoradiation or in identifying patients who will have limited benefit from chemoradiation and should therefore be selected for a more aggressive systemic regimen.

PROM1 was considered positive when > 10% of tumour glands were stained. VEGFA was considered positive when > 10% of tumour cells were stained, using endothelial cells as a positive control. MKI67 was considered high when > 30% of tumour cells were stained and TP53 when > 50% of tumour cells were stained.	Preoperative treatment included pelvic radiotherapy (1.8 Gy daily for a total of 50.4 Gy) and concomitant chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens were UFT-leucovorin (27 patients), oxaliplatin and raltitrexed (42 patients) or oxaliplatin and capecitabine (19 patients). Surgery was performed 6-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy and follow-up was scheduled according to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. A more detailed report of the treatment plan and follow-up has been published.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: Tumour regression grade (TRG) as defined by Rödel et al. has been used as an independent prognostic factor for rectal carcinoma after preoperative treatment by chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Determination of TRG 2 and 3, semiquantitatively defined as more or less than 50% tumour regression, respectively, does not appear to correlate with prognosis. The purpose of this study was to find an immunohistochemical pattern to permit improved stratification of intermediate responders defined by disease free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). METHOD: Immunohistochemistry of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), CD133 antibody, p53 antibody and Ki67 antibody was evaluated using tissue microarrays (TMA) on post-treatment surgical specimens from 88 patients. CD133 expression was confirmed in the whole section when available. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 40 months, TRG was found to be an independent predictor of DFS (P = 0.05) and OS (P = 0.001) but no differences were found between TRG 2 and 3 in terms of DFS (P = 0.74) or OS (P = 0.41). The results of TMA showed an immunohistochemically poor prognostic profile for intermediate responders configured by negativity of CD133 expression. However, when examining CD133 expression in the whole section, there was an intermediate correlation with TMA and the prognostic significance was lost. CONCLUSION: The results did not confirm the value of immunohistochemistry in predicting the prognosis of patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. This questions the accuracy of TMA in detecting CD133 expression in this setting.	Colorectal Disease	Stage 0: 8 patients, Stage I: 23 patients, Stage II: 30 patients, Stage III: 27 patients.
41	Absence of cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression is a predictor of tumor regression in rectalcancer treated with preoperative short-term chemoradiotherapy	English	2007	17308999	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17308999	Journal Article	\N	52	36	16	62	\N	[41.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The intensity of staining was scored as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium), and 3 (strong). The distribution of staining was scored as 0 (0 percent), 1 (1-25 percent), 2 (26-50 percent), 3 (51-75 percent), and 4 (76-100 percent). The sum of the intensity and distribution score was used as the final staining score (0 to 7) for PTGS2. Tumors with final score of ≥ 3 were considered as positive. TP53 positivity was determined by the presence of nuclear staining in more than 10 percent of neoplastic cells.	Fifty-two consecutive patients with lower rectal cancer, of which depth of tumor was diagnosed preoperatively as T3 or T4 (American Joint Committee on Cancer), underwent short-term preoperative chemoradiotherapy (20 Gy given in 5 daily doses of 4 Gy and administration of Tegafur/Uracil 400 mg/day for 7 days from the beginning to the end of irradiation), followed by TME (total mesorectal excision) in three weeks atthe National Defense Medical College from September 2001 to May 2005.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision has become the standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. This study was designed to determine whether pretreatment cyclooxygenase-2 and p53 protein expression were predictors of histopathologic response in patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative short-term chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with low rectal cancer received short-term preoperative chemoradiotherapy (20 Gy given in 5 daily doses of 4 Gy and concurrent administration of Tegafur/Uracil 400 mg/day), followed by total mesorectal excision. Cyclooxygenase-2 and p53 protein expression were measured by immunohistochemistry before and at the time of resection. Tumor regression grading was evaluated according to the criteria by Rodel (Grade 4, complete regression; Grade 3, regression >50 percent; Grade 2, 25-50 percent; Grade 1,<25 percent; and Grade 0, no regression). RESULTS: Two patients had a pathologic complete response. Good response (Grade 3 + 4) was found in 57.7 percent of the resected specimens. Cyclooxygenase-2 was expressed in 80.8 percent of patients before chemoradiotherapy and in 100 percent after chemoradiotherapy. The rates of good response (Grade 3 + 4) were significantly associated with lack of cyclooxygenase-2 expression before chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.021). However, there was no correlation between p53 protein expression and tumor regression grading. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with tumor lacking cyclooxygenase-2 expression before chemoradiotherapy are more likely to demonstrate good response to treatment. Cyclooxygenase-2 protein expression may be a marker for response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.	Disease of the Colon & Rectum	T1: 3 patients, T2: 13 patients, T3: 34 patients.
42	Can p53 alterations be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2000	10927144	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10927144	Journal Article	\N	48	\N	\N	58	\N	[35.0,85.0)	Immunohistochemistry	We have found the 5% cut-off score to be the most sensitive in terms of the prognostic value observed for TP53 staining in these tumour types.	Preoperative therapy involved two cycles of concurrent bolus 5-FU (5-fluorouracil). Pelvic radiotherapy was delivered over 5 weeks. Surgery was scheduled 4-6 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. Following completion of surgery, patients received a further four cycles of infusional 5-FU 500 mg/㎡ delivered over 5 days every 28 days. 5-FU (500 mg/㎡ ) was delivered by bolus IV infusion over 10 min for 3 days in week 1 (days 1, 2, 3) of the schedule and for 3 days in week 4 (days 22, 23, 24) of the schedule. Megavoltage equipment (6 MV and above) was used. A four-field box technique (anterior, posterior and lateral fields) was used, with all fields being treated each day. The dose delivered was 45 Gy to the International Commission of Radiological Units and Measurements (ICRU) point delivered in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. Wedges and compensation were used to bring the dose within the target volume to ±5% of the specified dose.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To examine whether p53 tumour suppressor gene alterations can be used to predict tumour response to pre-operative chemo-radiation in locally advanced rectal cancer in terms of reduction in tumour size and local failure. METHODS: p53 alterations were studied in pre-treatment biopsy specimens of rectal carcinomas from 48 patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction/single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) gene mutation analysis. Pre-operative pelvic radiotherapy was delivered with four fields, 45 Gy to the ICRU point in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. A radio-sensitising dose of 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/m(2)) was delivered concurrently for 6 days of the 5-week schedule (days 1, 2, 3 and days 22, 23 and 24). Total meso-rectal excision was planned 4 to 6 weeks from completion of pre-operative treatment. Response to therapy was assessed by macroscopic measurement of the surgical specimen by a pathologist who was unaware of the pre-treatment tumour size or of the p53 status. RESULTS: IHC evidence of p53 protein accumulation was found in 40% of tumours, p53 gene mutation in 35% and p53 alteration (either or both changes) in 46%. The average reduction in tumour size was 53% in the group with 'wild-type' p53 (IHC-/SSCP-) and 63% in the group with altered p53 (either IHC+ or SSCP+; P=0.18). No significant differences in tumour size reduction or local failure were observed in the groups with p53 overexpression or p53 mutation compared with normal. CONCLUSIONS: p53 alteration detected by IHC or SSCP analysis is not a clinically useful predictor of local response to pre-operative adjuvant therapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.

245	Hypoxia-regulated carbonic anhydrase-9 (CA9) relates to poor vascularization and resistance of squamous cell head and neck cancer to chemoradiotherapy	English	2001	11705854	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11705854	Journal Article	\N	75	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/ week; total dose 68-72 Gy; LINAC 6 MV X-ray irradiation) concurrently with carboplatin (area under the curve, 5 every 4 weeks or area under the curve 1 from day 1 to day 9 and from day 31 to day 39 of radiotherapy). None of the patients underwent surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Carbonic anhydrases are proteins involved in the catalytic hydration of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid. Recent studies show that carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) is up-regulated by hypoxia and that its immunohistochemical tissue distribution follows the distribution of the radiosensitizer pimonidazole (C. C. Wykoff et al., Cancer Res. 60: 7075-7083, 2001). Therefore, CA9 expression may show hypoxia levels of clinical importance. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed the expression of CA9 and the microvessel density (MVD; CD31-positive) in 75 locally advanced squamous cell head and neck cancers treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin. RESULTS: Strong membrane/cytoplasmic CA9 expression, noted in 20/75 (26.6%) tumors, mainly occurred in tumors with very poor vascularization (expression in 63% versus 14%; P < 0.0001), was located around areas of focal necrosis, and was related to poor complete response rate (40% versus 70%; P = 0.02). These observations suggested that CA9 might be a marker of clinically important hypoxia. Combining the CA9 staining and the tumor angiogenicity (MVD), we identified three groups of patients: (a) hypoxic tumors; (b) euoxic highly angiogenic tumors; and (c) euoxic non-highly angiogenic tumors. Groups (a) and (b) had a very poor local relapse-free survival (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Stratification of patients undergoing radical radiotherapy using the CA9/MVD model may be useful for the individualization of therapeutic strategies combining antiangiogenesis and hypoxia targeting with radiotherapy.

TP53 ≥35%, CDKN1A ≥10%, MKI67 ≥60% were considered as positive.	Preoperative radiotherapy was performed with 18 MV X-ray by a linear accelerator (Clinac 2100C, Varion Med System, Inc. Palo Alto, CA) using the two-field technique (anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior fields). Irradiation was carried out once (2 Gy) daily with a total dose of 20 Gy. Surgery was done 2 weeks (range 9-18 days) after completion of the irradiation, and 15 Gy of electron beam was delivered during surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: In order to determine the reliable predictors of response to radiotherapy for rectal cancer, we assessed apoptosis, p53 and p21 in biopsy specimens collected before treatment, and investigated the relationships to the histological effect of irradiation and the degree of tumor shrinkage. METHODS: Ninety-three patients with advanced rectal adenocarcinoma were treated with preoperative irradiation of 20 Gy in 10 fractions in combination with intraoperative electron beam irradiation of 15 Gy. We evaluated tumor grade, pathological tumor regression, biological markers associated with apoptosis and proliferation [apoptotic index (AI), p53, p21 and Ki67], and the degree of tumor shrinkage. RESULTS: Considering positivity of p21 and of apoptosis and negativity of p53 as favorable factors in tumor shrinkage, we compared the degree of shrinkage among the patients using the number of favorable factors as the score. The degree of shrinkage was 41.5 +/- 8.5% in patients with three favorable factors, 31.4 +/- 9.7% in patients with two favorable factors and 26.5 +/- 11.2% in patients with one favorable factor. However, there was no significant difference in the proportion of marked regression according to the number of favorable factors. CONCLUSIONS: Histological examination of apoptosis, p21 and p53 in biopsy specimens and scoring were considered to be useful predictive methods for assessing the efficacy of radiotherapy for rectal cancer.

45	Predictive value of Ki67 and p53 in locally advanced rectal cancer: Correlation with thymidylate synthase and histopathological tumor regression after neoadjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy	English	2008	18286688	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18286688	Journal Article	\N	40	33	7	62	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time PCR; Immunohistochemistry	Samples with MKI67 nuclear staining equal or above 40% were considered having a high proliferative index, whereas nuclear positivity below 40% was considered a low proliferative index. TP53 was considered overexpressed when ≥ 10% of the malignant nuclei were positive. If fewer than 10% of the nuclei were stained, the slide was scored as having normal TP53 expression.	In all patients, locally curative (R0) tumor resection was achieved after standardized preoperative chemoradiotherapy. During radiotherapy with a total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy delivered in 28 fractions) 5-FU was administered as a 120-h continuous intravenous infusion of 1000 mg/㎡ per day during the first and fifth weeks. Standardized surgery including total mesorectal excision was scheduled 5 wk after completion of preoperative treatment and clinical restaging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: To investigate the predictive value of Ki67 and p53 and their correlation with thymidylate synthase (TS) gene expression in a rectal cancer patient cohort treated according to a standardized recommended neoadjuvant treatment regimen. METHODS: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (n = 22) and post-therapeutical resection specimens (n = 40) from patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (clinical UICC stage II/III) receiving standardized neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based chemoradiotherapy were studied for Ki67 and p53 expression by immunohistochemistry and correlated with TS mRNA expression by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR after laser microdissection. The results were compared with histopathological tumor regression according to a standardized semiquantitative score grading system. RESULTS: Responders (patients with high tumor regression) showed a significantly lower Ki67 expression than non-responders in the pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (81.2% vs 16.7%; P < 0.05) as well as in the post-therapeutical resection specimens (75.8% vs 14.3%; P < 0.01). High TS mRNA expression was significantly correlated with a high Ki67 index and low TS mRNA expression was significantly correlated with a low Ki67 index in the pre-therapeutical tumor biopsies (corr. coef. = 0.46; P < 0.01) as well as in the post-therapeutical resection specimens (corr. coef. = 0.40; P < 0.05). No significant association was found between p53 and TS mRNA expression or tumor regression. CONCLUSION: Ki67 has, like TS, predictive value in rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant 5-FU based chemoradiotherapy. The close correlation between Ki67 and TS indicates that TS is involved in active cell cycle processes.

46	Prospective validation of the prognostic value of elevated serum vascular endothelial growthfactor in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: more distant metastases and shorter overall survival after treatment	English	2011	20967862	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20967862	Journal Article	\N	306	228	78	\N	\N	\N	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay	\N	All patients were treated with continuously definitive radiotherapy with daily fractions of 2.0 Gy and 5 fractions per week by linear accelerator (6-8 MV). The radiation doses to the nasopharynx, lymphnode-positive area, and lymphnode-negative area ranged from 60 to 78 Gy, 60 to 70 Gy, and 50 to 60 Gy, respectively. A total of 226 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, with 147 treated with inductive chemotherapy, 27 treated with concurrent chemotherapy, and 52 treated with inductive chemotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the prognostic value of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (sVEGF) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: sVEGF was prospectively detected in 306 patients with NPC with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before treatment. The correlations between sVEGF and the survival of these patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Patients were followed for at least 36 months. The mean sVEGF was 387.0 ng/L. sVEGF showed no difference in sex, age, and local recurrence. However, sVEGF was positively associated with histology, TNM classification, distant metastasis, and overall survival (OS; p < .05). The 4-year OS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of the high-sVEGF versus low-sVEGF groups were 68% versus 86% and 70% versus 89%, respectively (p < .05). Stratified analysis showed that patients with stage IV(a,b) , T(4) , N(1) , or N(positive) disease with high VEGF levels had worse 4-year OS and 4-year DMFS than those with low VEGF levels (p < .05). Multifactorial Cox regression confirmed sVEGF was among the independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Elevation of sVEGF in patients with NPC predicts more posttreatment distant metastases and shorter OS and can be used as an independent poor prognostic indicator.

47	In vitro radiation-induced expression of XPC mRNA as a possible biomarker for developing adverse reactions during radiotherapy	English	2007	17657713	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17657713	Journal Article	\N	99	99	\N	\N	\N	[48.0,79.0)	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	All patients were treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy with a target dose of 61-72 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	Repair of radiation-induced DNA damage is believed to play a critical role in developing adverse reactions during radiotherapy. Ionizing radiation induces transcription of several DNA repair genes including XPC as a part of the p53-transmitted stress response. XPC gene induction was measured to analyze whether it predicts occurrence of therapy-related acute side effects. Prostate cancer patients (n = 406) receiving radiotherapy were monitored for development of acute adverse effects using common toxicity criteria. For gene induction analysis, lymphocytes from 99 patients were selected according to their observed grade of clinical side effects. Cells were irradiated in vitro with 5 Gy and analyzed after 4 hr for XPC gene induction using reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Analysis of modulation of XPC induction by personal, clinical or lifestyle factors was included. Inter-individual induction of XPC expression by ionizing radiation varied up to 20-fold (0.29-5.77) and was significantly higher in current or exsmokers than in never-smokers (p value: 0.008). Patients with XPC induction above the 90th percentile compared to those with lower induction levels were at increased risk of suffering from adverse reactions during radiotherapy (odds ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2-24.5; adjusted for smoking). In summary, XPC mRNA levels induced by ionizing radiation were shown for the first time to be strongly affected by smoking and to be associated with an approximately 5-fold increased risk for developing acute side effects of radiotherapy. The predictive value of DNA damage-induced XPC levels as a possible biomarker for radiosensitivity has to be further investigated.	International Journal of Cancer	\N
67	Hedgehog pathway signaling in cervical carcinoma and outcome after chemoradiation	English	2012	22028038	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22028038	Journal Article	\N	85	\N	85	47	\N	[26.0,79.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	All patients received external-beam radiotherapy to the primary cervical tumor and pelvic lymph nodes regardless of whether or not enlarged pelvic lymph nodes were identified on pretreatment imaging studies. Patients with enlarged pelvic lymph nodes also received treatment of low para-aortic lymph nodes because of the high risk of occult para-aortic lymph node metastases in this setting. A 4-field box technique was used to treat the pelvis, and anterior-posterior parallelopposed fields were used for the pelvis and para-aortic lymph nodes. An external-beam radiation dose from 45 to 50 grays (Gy) in 1.8-Gy to 2-Gy daily fractions was delivered using 18-megavolt to 25-megavolt photons. During external-beam radiation, patients received weekly doses of cisplatin 40 mg/㎡ (total, 5 doses). Externalradiation was followed by a single intrauterine brachytherapy treatment using low-dose-rate or pulsed-dose-rate equipment. A brachytherapy dose from 35 to 40 Gy was prescribed to a point 2cm lateral to the applicator at the level of the external cervical os.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Hedgehog (Hh) signaling was assessed in patients with primary cervical carcinoma who were receiving chemoradiation. Because the up-regulation of Hh has been reported in response to hypoxia, the authors examined associations between Hh gene expression and measurements of HP5 (the percentage of oxygen pressure readings in each tumor <5 mm Hg) and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). METHODS: Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Indian hedgehog (IHH), patched 1 and 2 (PTCH1 and PTCH2), smoothened (SMO), and glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) expression levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis on 85 frozen samples of primary cervical carcinoma and on 16 normal cervical samples. Clinicopathologic data were collected prospectively. Possible correlations between Hh expression and tumor hypoxia (HP5 and IFP) measured at the time of biopsy, the time to local recurrence, and disease-free survival (DFS) were examined. RESULTS: At least 1 member of the Hh pathway was elevated in all but 1 tumor compared with normal tissue (P < .0001). Hh gene expression was heterogeneous with SHH, IHH, and GLI exhibiting bimodal distribution. Elevation of SHH expression (P = .04) and low SMO expression (P = .0007) were associated with HP5. The risk of local recurrence was associated with the up-regulation of SMO (hazard ratio [HR], 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-5.82; P = .044), the up-regulation of >3 Hh genes (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.09-6.00; P = .026), tumor size (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.14-1.74; P = .0015), and lymph node-positive disease (HR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.16-6.86; P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of tumors that expressed Hh genes in cervical cancer was very high. The current data support a role for the Hh pathway in repopulation after chemoradiation and suggest that SMO may be a valid therapeutic target. The authors concluded that further investigation into this pathway after radiation and Hh inhibition are warranted.

All patients in this study were treated with breast conserving surgery with or without axillary lymph node dissection between 1975 and 2003. Following surgery, patients received standard whole breast irradiation, at the radiation oncology facilities of the Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale University School of Medicine. The median dose to the whole breast was 48 Gy, followed routinely by an electron conedown for a total median dose of 64.0 Gy. Regional nodes were treated to a median dose of 46 Gy, as clinically indicated and previously described. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and/or adjuvant hormone therapy was administered as clinically indicated in accordance with standard practices during this time interval.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to evaluate the prognostic significance of Bcl-2, a apoptosis-related protein, in patients with early stage breast cancer treated with breast conservation treatment (BCT). METHODS: After obtaining IRB approval, 504 patients with early stage breast cancer treated with BCT were entered in this study. The paraffin specimens were constructed into tissue micro-arrays with two-fold redundancy, processed and stained for Bcl-2 antibody. Bcl-2 expression was correlated with other clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression was identified in 116 cases (28%). Bcl-2 expression was positively correlated with both estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status (P < 0.0001, respectively). Bcl-2 expression was associated with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (P = 0.0322, by log-rank test). Multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard model showed that Bcl-2 expression still retained significance as an independent prognostic factor for breast recurrence (P = 0.0348). CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 expression is highly associated with an increased risk of local recurrence in patients with early stage breast cancer. Immunohistochemical staining of the primary tumor for Bcl-2 might be useful to select optimal treatment options for these patients.	Breast Cancer Research and Treatment	\N

For the evaluation of immunoreactivity of CD44 in stroma, we defined the high expression group as cases that its strong expressions were localized in cancer stroma surrounding cancer nests.	Patients with rectal cancer were treated with short-course (a dose of 20 Gy in 4 fractions) or long-course (a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions) radiotherapy using a 4-field box technique with concurrent chemotherapy to take advantage of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) radio- sensitization. Patients underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy (intravenous infusion of 5-FU: 600 mg/㎡ for 24 h, and tegafur-uracil (UFT) given as 400 mg/㎡ orally for 5 days. This regimen was based on the previously tested combination of continuous infusion of 5-FU and oral administration of UFT. Short-course radiotherapy in our institute is different from standard short-course radiotherapy, 25 Gy in 5 fractions. There are several reasons that we designed the present regimen. We calculated a biologically equivalent dose (BED) of 20 Gy in 4 fractions using a linear quadratic model (25) and its BED was 30 Gy (α/β ratio: 10 Gy). We understand that BED: 30 Gy had a sufficient efficacy reducing the local failure of radiotherapy (26). Forty-two patients received short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy over 1 week. The remaining 10 patients received long-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 4 weeks. The time interval between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery was 2-3 weeks in short-course irradiation patients, and 4-6 weeks in long-course irradiation patients. All patients underwent standard surgery including total mesorectal excision, and received 5-FU based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	LGR5, known as a target of Wnt signaling, has been reported as an intestinal stem cell marker. Recent reports showed that LGR5 was associated with carcinogenesis and tumor invasion in colorectal cancer. CD44 is a ubiquitously expressed cell adhesion molecule and also a potential cell surface marker on colon cancer stem cells. Both LGR5 and CD44 have been also reported to be Wnt signal targets. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of these markers with clinical outcome in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). A total of 52 rectal cancer specimens were obtained from patients who underwent preoperative CRT. We performed transcriptional and immunohistochemical analyses, and retrospectively studied the association of LGR5 and CD44 expression levels with clinical outcomes. For CD44, its expression in cancer stroma was also evaluated. The levels of cancer LGR5 and CD44 gene expression were significantly and positively correlated. LGR5 gene expression level in cancer and positivity of CD44 gene expression in cancer stroma were significantly correlated with disease recurrence. Elevated cancer LGR5 gene expression and positive CD44 gene expression in cancer stroma were significantly associated with poor recurrence-free and overall survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that positivity of stromal CD44 gene expression was an independent prognostic factor for the recurrence and overall survival of patients with rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. In conclusion, LGR5 and CD44 expression may be coordinately associated with tumor relapse in locally advanced rectal cancer after preoperative CRT.

50	Prognostic significance of glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) gene expression in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy	English	2012	22072148	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072148	Journal Article	\N	52	42	10	64.5	\N	[37.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	At our institution, patients with rectal cancer were treated with short-course (a dose of 20 Gy in four fractions) or long-course (a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions) radiotherapy using a four-field box technique. Patients underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy (intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU): 600 mg/㎡ for 24 h, and tegafur/uracil given as 400 mg/㎡ orally for 5 days) to take advantage of 5-FU-mediated radiosensitization.This regimen was based on the previously tested combination of continuous infusion of 5-FU and oral administration of tegafur/uracil. Forty-two patients received short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy over 1 week. The remaining 10 patients received long-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 4 weeks. The time interval between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery was 2-3 weeks in short-course irradiation patients, and 4-6 weeks in long-course irradiation patients. No delay in any treatment due to severe toxicity was experienced. All patients underwent standard surgery including a total mesorectal excision, and received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Most cancer cells exhibit increased glycolysis. The elevated glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression has been reported to be associated with resistance to therapeutic agents and a poor prognosis. We wondered whether GLUT1 expression was associated with the clinical outcome in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and whether glycolysis inhibition could represent a novel anticancer treatment. METHODS: We obtained total RNA from residual cancer cells using microdissection from a total of 52 rectal cancer specimens from patients who underwent preoperative CRT. We performed transcriptional analyzes, and studied the association of the GLUT1 gene expression levels with the clinical outcomes. In addition, we examined each proliferative response of three selected colorectal cancer cell lines to a glycolysis inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvic acid (3-BrPA), with regard to their expression of the GLUT1 gene. RESULTS: An elevated GLUT1 gene expression was associated with a high postoperative stage, the presence of lymph node metastasis, and distant recurrence. Moreover, elevated GLUT1 gene expression independently predicted both the recurrence-free and overall survival. In the in vitro studies, we observed that 3-BrPA significantly suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells with high GLUT1 gene expression, compared with those with low expression. CONCLUSION: An elevated GLUT1 expression may be a useful predictor of distant recurrence and poor prognosis in rectal cancer patients after preoperative CRT.

51	Gefitinib, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer: EGFR FISH, protein expression, and mutational status are not predictive biomarkers	English	2012	21768327	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21768327	Journal Article	\N	31	24	7	55	\N	[44.4,74.4)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Gefitinib 500 mg daily was started 3 weeks before the start of CTRT (chemoradiotherapy) and would continue at the same dose into the CTRT phase and thereafter for 4 months as consolidation phase. Cisplatin was given at 20 mg/㎡/day on days 1-4 during weeks 1, 4, and 7 of RT (radiotherapy). This fractionated schedule was used due to the high incidence of breakthrough emesis despite 5-hydroxotryptamine 3 antagonist with high-dose single-day cisplatin in our patients. This study was conducted before the availability of aprepitant in this center. The primary tumor and the entire neck were treated using a linear accelerator to provide 6 MV photons and electron beams of appropriate energies. The primary tumor and the clinically and radiologically involved nodes received 70 Gy in 7 weeks and the rest of the neck received 60 Gy in 6 weeks. 	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Gefitinib was demonstrated to be synergistic with cisplatin and radiotherapy (RT) in in vitro studies. Biomarkers predictive of response to gefitinib in squamous cell head and neck cancer is still lacking. METHODS: Thirty-one patients with locally advanced and easily accessible primary tumor sites for biopsies were recruited. Gefitinib was started 3 weeks before the start of cisplatin/concurrent radiotherapy (CTRT) and continued during the CTRT phase and thereafter for 4 months as consolidation phase. Two baselines and a repeat tumor sample were taken after 2 weeks of gefitinib alone to study its impact on tumor gene expression. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) protein expression, FISH and mutational status, and matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11) protein expression were correlated with response and survival outcome. RESULTS: The overall response rate to gefitinib alone was 9.7%. The survival outcome is as follows: median disease free 1.3 years, median survival time 2.4 years, 3-year disease free 42.9%, and 3-year overall survival 48.4%. EGFR FISH, protein expression, and mutational status did not predict for response nor survival outcome of patients. Although MMP11 overexpression did not predict for response, it predicted significantly for a poorer survival outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Gefitinib can be combined safely with cisplatin/RT. More studies are needed to uncover predictive biomarkers of benefit to gefitinib.	Annals of Oncology	Stage III: 1 patients, Stage IVA: 28 patients, Stage IVB: 2 patients.
52	Carbonic anhydrase XII expression is associated with histologic grade of cervical cancer and superior radiotherapy outcome	English	2010	21040567	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21040567	Journal Article	\N	183	\N	183	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	CA12 expression was scored as positive (≥ 5%) or negative (< 5%).	Radiotherapy consisted of whole-pelvic external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. A midline block (MLB) was inserted at 36-45 Gy, and the rest of the pelvis was treated with up to 45-50.4 Gy. HDR brachytherapy was performed at the beginning of MLB with fractional doses of 4-5 Gy, as 5-7 fractions twice a week. Most patients received concomitant weekly cisplatin (40 mg/㎡) during EBRT, except for 26 elderly patients with expected poor compliance. Ten patients with stage IVB cervical cancer received 5-FU/cisplatin chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: To investigate whether expression of carbonic anhydrase XII (CA12) is associated with histologic grade of the tumors and radiotherapy outcomes of the patients with invasive cervical cancer. METHODS: CA12 expression was examined by immunohistochemical stains in cervical cancer tissues from 183 radiotherapy patients. Histological grading was classified as well (WD), moderately (MD) or poorly differentiated (PD). Oligonucleotide microarray experiment was performed using seven cervical cancer samples to examine differentially expressed genes between WD and PD cervical cancers. The association between CA12 and histological grade was analyzed by chi-square test. CA12 and histological grades were analyzed individually and as combined CA12 and histologic grade categories for effects on survival outcome. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical expression of CA12 was highly associated with the histologic grade of cervical cancer. Lack of CA12 expression was associated with PD histology, with an odds ratio of 3.9 (P = 0.01). Microarray analysis showed a fourfold reduction in CA12 gene expression in PD tumors. CA12 expression was marginally associated with superior disease-free survival. Application of the new combined categories resulted in further discrimination of the prognosis of patients with moderate and poorly differentiated tumor grade. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that CA12 may be used as a novel prognostic marker in combination with histologic grade of the tumors.

53	IGF1R gene expression as a predictive marker of response to ionizing radiation for patients with locally advanced HPV16-positive cervical cancer	English	2012	23060553	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23060553	Journal Article	\N	38	\N	38	46	\N	[33.0,70.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	All 38 patients included in the study underwent radiotherapy-only. Treatment consisted of pelvic EBRT (external beam radiotherapy) using 6 to 18 MV photons with a standard four-field technique delivering a total dose of 45 Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions (1.8 Gy per fraction, five consecutive days per week, overall EBRT treatment time of five weeks). After initial EBRT, low-dose rate or high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy-boost was delivered using cesium or iridium sources, respectively, for an equivalent low-dose rate dose of 35 Gy at point A, according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). The total doses of radiation ranged from 80 Gy and 60 to 66 Gy to the ICRU points A and B, respectively.	Radiotherapy	5	AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive utility of Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), IGF1, IGF2, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and of hemoglobin levels for tumor response to exclusive radiotherapy, in patients with locally advanced Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16-positive cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 102 patients treated at our institutes, 38 patients with histologically-proven HPV16-positive cervical cancer were included in this prospective case-controlled study. All patients underwent exclusive radiotherapy-only. Complete response was defined as an absence of residual disease at clinical examination and radiological imaging, three months after the completion of treatment. Gene expression levels, assessed before radiotherapy, were compared between responders and non-responders. Controls consisted of normal cervical tissue samples from 30 patients with non-oncological indications. RESULTS: Twenty patients (52.6%) showed a complete response. Gene expressions of IGF1R (34%), IGF2 (24%), and GAPDH (median=3.26 versus 2.12) were increased in cancer patients, in comparison with the control group. Higher levels of expression of GAPDH were observed in patients co-expressing IGF2 and IGF1R, who had a hemoglobin level ≤ 11 g/dl (p=0.05). Clinical characteristics in the responder and in the non-responder groups were similar. In bi-variate and multi-variate analyses, IGF1R expression was the only factor predictive of response to radiotherapy (p=0.018). Accordingly, patients with IGF1R expression had a 28.6-fold greater risk of treatment failure. CONCLUSION: In our study, IGF1R was a strong predictive marker of lack of response to radiotherapy. Larger prospective trials are needed to validate IGF1R as a biomarker of radiation response for patients with HPV16-positive cervical cancer.

54	Expression of glioma stem cell marker CD133 and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is associated with resistance to radiotherapy in gliomas	English	2011	21769436	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21769436	Journal Article	\N	59	36	23	57	\N	[37.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The immunoreactivity of PROM1 or MGMT protein was evaluated semi-quantitatively according to the percentage of positive-stained cells: <10% was regarded as negative (-), 10-25% as low reactivity (+), >25-50% as moderate reactivity (++), and >50% as high reactivity (+++).	Patients received only standard-fractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy total dose; 2 Gy x 5 days/week for 6 weeks) after surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	In the present study, we investigated the prognostic roles of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene methylation status, the protein profiles of MGMT, and the glioma stem cell (GSC) marker CD133 in malignant glioma resistance to radiotherapy. The proliferation of glioma cells was assessed using a clonogenic survival assay and flow cytometry. CD133 expression was assessed in SHG-44-GSCs using RT-PCR and flow cytometry. MGMT exhibited resistance to radiation in the SHG-44-GSCs using siRNA transfection. The effects of the siRNA on mRNA and protein expression of MGMT in SHG-44-GSCs were detected using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. MGMT methylation status, MGMT and CD133 expression profiles were assessed in 59 malignant glioma patients using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP), and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, SHG-44-GSCs exhibited a characteristic resistance to radiation that was not observed in SHG-44 cells. This resistance was attributed to the unmethylated status of the MGMT promoter and to high expression levels of MGMT mRNA in the glioma cells. In these patients, the CD133 marker, but not MGMT promoter methylation or MGMT protein level, was associated with resistance to radiotherapy (n=59; hazard ratio=2.838; 95% CI, 1.725-7.597; p=0.001). The median progression-free survival (PFS) among patients with the CD133 marker was 14 months, whereas it was 35 months in patients without CD133 (p=0.001). Notably, co-expression of the methylated MGMT promoter and the CD133 marker was associated with the poorest outcome in patients with gliomas treated by radiotherapy; in these patients, PFS was 7 months. These results suggest that assessment of GSC MGMT and CD133 levels will guide future clinical targeted therapies and stratify glioma patient treatment regimens. High expression levels of the CD133 protein could be used as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with radiotherapy.	Oncology Reports	\N

Extension was graded from 0 to 5: 0 (0%), 1 (<10%), 2 (11-25%), 3 (26-50%), 4 (51-75%), and 5 (>76%). Intensity was graded semiquantitatively from 0 to 3: 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium), and 3 (strong) For statistical evaluation, tumors having a final VEGFA staining score of ≥4 were considered to be positive. Final PTGS2 staining scores >0 defined PTGS2-positive tumors.	Preoperative pelvic radiotherapy was given with conventional fractionation, 1.80 Gy/day, 5 fractions/week to a total dose of 45 Gy. In 8 patients, a 5.4-Gy boost was given to the tumor. Forty-five patients received simultaneous 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Details of treatment had previously been reported. Subsequently, all patients underwent surgery, 48 having low anterior resection (59%) and 33 abdominoperineal removal (41%). In all cases, a total mesorectal resection was performed. A pathological study of the surgical specimen was performed and the tumor was pathologically staged according to current UICC criteria. The median time between radiotherapy and surgery was 52 days (range 34-68).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To analyze the prognostic value of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy. METHODS: Eighty-one patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were studied. All patients received preoperative pelvic radiotherapy. Forty-seven patients received concomitant chemotherapy. Surgical resection was performed 4-8 weeks later in all patients. Immunohistochemical examination of COX-2 and VEGF was performed on the preirradiation diagnostic biopsies. An immunohistochemical score established from the extension and intensity of the markers was used for analysis. The log-rank test and proportional hazards regression analysis were used to calculate the probability that the biomarkers were associated with patient outcome. RESULTS: COX-2 expression was positive in 38 tumors (51%) while VEGF expression was positive in 43 (57%). The only clinicopathological parameter significantly associated with COX-2 or VEGF expression was performance status. None of the 2 markers were found to predict treatment response. There was no statistically significant correlation between COX-2 and VEGF. Univariate analysis identified pathological stage (pT, pN) as prognostic for disease-free survival. When VEGF expression was analyzed, disease-free survival was reduced among patients with VEGF-positive tumors (p = 0.047). This was specifically related to metastases-free survival (p = 0.016). These results were not observed for COX-2. After multivariate analysis, the pT and pN stage remained as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: VEGF-positive expression is an indicator of poor disease-free survival, specifically linked to distant metastasis. More aggressive treatment strategies are warranted in pT3-4 and pN1-2 rectal cancer patients.	Oncology	T0: 9 patients, T1-2: 18 patients, T3-4: 54 patients; N0: 53 patients, N1-2: 27 patients.

TOP2A and MKI67: Tumors with distinct nuclear staining in ≥70% of cells were considered to have an elevated proliferation rate. BCL2: Tumors with cytoplasmic staining in >50% of cells were considered positive.	The patients were treated preoperatively with 5-Fluorouracil (300 or 225 mg/㎡/day by continuous infusion 5 days per week) and escalating doses of CPT-11 (30 to 60 mg/㎡ weekly x 4) and radiation (45-54 Gray). Surgery was performed 6-10 weeks after the preoperative therapy was completed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) and expression of cell cycle-related markers may predict a favorable outcome in colorectal cancer patients. The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular profiles of patients with rectal cancers treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-Fluorouracil and CPT-11), radiotherapy and surgery that correlate with response to therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with rectal cancer were treated with the same preoperative chemotherapy regimen, radiotherapy (45 to 54 Gy) followed by surgery. The microsatellite status, the expression of the mismatch repair proteins MLH1 and MSH2 and p21WAF1/C1PI, p27, bcl-2, topoisomerase II (topo II) and Ki-67 were assessed in the pretreatment biopsies. The response to adjuvant therapy was categorized in the resected specimens as complete response (CR, no microscopic residual tumor present) and partial response (PR, tumor present). RESULTS: p21WAF1/C1PI, expression characterized the CR with 12 out of 30 tumors (40%) positive for this marker. None of the patients whose tumors did not express p21WAFI/C1PI (10 patients) was a CR (p=0.011). Overall, the tumors with CR also showed higher expression of bcl-2, Ki-67, topo II and p27. However, p53 was more frequently expressed in the PR tumors. Tumors with high microsatellite instability showed CR (3/5, 60%) more often than PR, whereas tumors with stable microsatellites showed PR (26/36, 80%) more often than CR (p=0.099). CONCLUSION: We conclude that a molecular profile characterized by high microsatellite instability with loss of mismatch repair protein expression and p21WAF1/C1PI is predictive of an improved response to neoadjuvant treatment with 5-FU, CPT-11 and radiation therapy.

Before surgery, patients were treated with a chemoirradiation regimen (cobalt-60 units) that consisted of 30 Gy of external-beam radiation in 10 fractions during a 2-week period (3 Gy/day, radiobiologically equivalent to 42 Gy), using a two-field box. The target volume included the upper limit of S1 as the superior border and the isquiatic line as the inferior border. Fluorinated pyrimidine (UFT) (500 mg twice a day) and folinic acid (12.5 mg twice a day) were given concomitantly, as radiosensitizing chemotherapy, during the 2 weeks of treatment. All patients completed the protocol. Radiotherapy was followed by surgery at an interval of 2-3 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between the histopathologic effects of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer and the proteins, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and p53. METHODS: Samples from 73 tumors were examined. The histopathologic effects observed in the resected specimens induced by preoperative chemoradiotherapy were correlated with the inmunohistochemical expression of PCNA and p53 in biopsies obtained by rectoscopy before chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Thirty-five tumors showed a high PCNA index (48%). Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was detected in 53 tumors (72%). Specimens were assigned one of four grades based on the amount of residual viable tumor. Three neoplasms (4%) showed complete regression; 8 other carcinomas (11%) showed only small numbers of tumor cells scattered within the field of stromal reaction. In these cases, it was considered that the tumor had responded significantly to radiotherapy. Tumors with a high PCNA index responded to chemoradiotherapy more frequently (8/35; 72%) than tumors with a low index (3/38; 43%) (p = 0.07). p53-negative tumors responded more frequently (4/20; 20%) than positive tumors (7/53; 13.2%) (p = 0.50). When pathologic and immunohistochemical characteristics of the tumors were included in a logistic regression model, only high PCNA index (odds ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval 1.07-26.7) (p = 0.04) was significantly associated with the histologic response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. CONCLUSION: High proliferative activity of rectal cancer, as determined by PCNA immunostaining, is predictive of the response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

Hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy up to 72 Gy was used in 69 patients, normofractionated treatment up two 70 Gy was used in 86 patients and a simultaneously integrated boost technique in 3 patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of the tumour volume, HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures, as potential markers of radiobiological mechanisms of radioresistance, in a contemporary cohort of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received primary radiochemotherapy (RCTx). MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 158 patients with locally advanced HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx or hypopharynx who were treated at six DKTK partner sites, the impact of tumour volume, HPV DNA, p16 overexpression, p53 expression, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of primary RCTx was retrospectively analyzed. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control (LRC). RESULTS: Univariate Cox regression revealed a significant impact of tumour volume, p16 overexpression, and SLC3A2 and CD44 protein expression on LRC. The tumour hypoxia classification showed a significant impact only for small tumours. In multivariate analyses an independent correlation of tumour volume, SLC3A2 expression, and the 15-gene hypoxia signature with LRC was identified (CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group). Logistic modelling showed that inclusion of CD44 protein expression and p16 overexpression significantly improved the performance to predict LRC at 2years compared to the model with tumour volume alone. CONCLUSIONS: Tumour volume, HPV status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia gene signatures are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC, who were treated by primary RCTx. The study also supports that the individual tumour volumes should generally be included in biomarker studies and that panels of biomarkers are superior to individual parameters.

We defined the expression pattern of XRCC6 as positive or negative as follows; 1) in the XRCC6-positive group, the percentage of cells positive for XRCC6 was the mean or more; 2) in the XRCC6-negative group, the percentage of cells positive for XRCC6 was less than the mean.	Preradiation biopsy specimens were obtained from 111 patients with rectal carcinoma who underwent preoperative radiation and surgical resection in our department. The total dose of radiation was 50 Gy in all cases.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The identification of predictive indicators of radiosensitivity is extremely useful in selecting patients suited for preoperative radiotherapy and avoiding unnecessary preoperative treatment. In this study, we evaluated the possible role of the immunohistochemical expression pattern of p53 and Ku70 protein in determining tumor radiosensitivity in rectal cancer before preoperative irradiation. We examined pretreatment biopsy materials from 111 patients by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern of p53 and Ku70 was evaluated for association with tumor radiosensitivity, which was defined according to the criteria of the Japanese Research Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. There was a significant correlation between the expression pattern of p53 and tumor radiosensitivity (P = 0.045); Ku70 and tumor radiosensitivity (P < 0.001); and the combination of p53 and Ku70, and tumor radiosensitivity (P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy in both p53 and Ku70-positive cases for radioresistance were all superior to those of the group positive for p53 alone. In conclusion the examination of the combination of p53 and Ku70 may predict the radiosensitivity of rectal cancer before preoperative irradiation.

Before surgery, patients treated with a chemotadiation regimen that consisted of 45 Gy of external-beam irradiation (1.8 Gy/day for 5 days/week) with concurrent continous-infusion 5-fluorouracil therapy (300 mg/㎡/day for 5 days/week). Six weeks after chemoradiation, the involved segments of bowel and mesorectum were resected.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	This study was conducted to investigate the value of p53 immunohistochemical staining of pretreatment biopsy specimens in predicting the response of rectal cancer to chemoradiation. The study group comprised 42 patients with high-risk rectal cancer treated between July 1990 and July 1995 with a preoperative chemoradiation regimen of 45 Gy of external-beam irradiation and continuous-infusion 5-fluorouracil followed by surgical resection. p53 immunohistochemical staining was performed on pretreatment biopsy specimens. p53 immunohistochemical staining pattern and standard clinical and pathological parameters were correlated with extent of residual cancer in the surgical specimen. Twenty tumors were positive for p53 on immunohistochemical staining, 19 were negative, and 3 were focally positive. Thirteen patients experienced a complete response to chemoradiation. Aberrant p53 protein accumulation, as measured by immunohistochemical staining, correlated inversely with a complete pathological response to chemoradiation (P = 0.005; correlation coefficient = -0.43) and directly with an increased likelihood of residual cancer in the lymph nodes of surgical specimens (P = 0.02; correlation coefficient = 0.39). p53 immunohistochemical staining of pretreatment biopsy specimens correlates with the extent of residual disease after chemoradiation in patients with high-risk rectal cancer.

According to staining intensity, colorless was regarded as grade 0, pale or whitish yellow (weakly positive) as grade 1, yellow (positive) as grade 2, and brown (strongly positive) as grade 3. Staining index counts were calculated according to the following formula: Staining index = grade according to the percentage of positive cells x grade according to staining intensity. A staining index of ≥ 3 was regarded as KDR positive.	In the combination and radiotherapy-alone groups, whole-brain radiotherapy was performed with the Oncor Express linear accelerator (Siemens, Germany) with isocenter irradiation of 6 MV-X, 3 Gy/time, 5 times/week for a total of 10 times; for a single lesion, 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy was performed with planning target volume prescription, DT10 Gy/5 times and 2 Gy/time, 5 times/week. The plan of radiotherapy was optimized and organ injury was evaluated with dose-volume histogram. RHES (Endostar) was purchased from Xian-sheng Pharmaceutical Co Ltd. Intravenous RHES was provided according to 7.5 mg/㎡ /day during radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	INTRODUCTION: Brain metastases are often accompanied by edema. Endostatin therapy can prevent tumor tissue edema. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effects of endostatin combined with radiotherapy in the treatment of brain metastases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and assessed the relations between the effect and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) expression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty patients with brain metastases of NSCLC were randomly divided into a combination therapy group and a radiotherapy-alone group, each group with 40 patients. The short-term effective rate, overall survival time, cerebral edema index, and adverse reactions were observed, and the expressions of VEGFR2 protein and KDR gene in primary lesions were detected via immunohistochemical methods and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) in all patients. RESULTS: Compared with the radiotherapy-alone group, brain edema was significantly relieved (P = .003) and there were no marked adverse reactions in the combination therapy group. Regarding the short-term effective rate, there was no statistical significance in the total population (n = 80, 90% vs. 75%, P = .07), but there was statistical significance in cases of positive VEGFR2 (93% vs. 67.7%, P = .012) or positive KDR gene (94.4% vs. 47.3%, P = .002) in both groups. For overall survival time, there was no statistical significance in total population (n = 80, P = .35), positive VEGFR2 patients (P = .109), and positive KDR gene patients (P = .147). CONCLUSION: Compared with radiotherapy alone, endostatin combined with radiotherapy can relieve brain edema in patients with brain metastases of NSCLC and can obtain a better short-term effective rate in patients with positive VEGFR2 or positive KDR gene, but endostatin therapy does not significantly improve overall survival time.

61	Mismatch Repair Gene Expression as a Predictor of Tumor Responses in Patients With Rectal Cancer Treated With Preoperative Chemoradiation	English	2016	26817916	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26817916	Journal Article	\N	209	136	73	56	\N	[27.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 protein expression levels were classified as negative for <10% nuclear staining, and positive for ≥10% nuclear staining.	All patients received peroperative chemoradiotherapy, which included pelvic radiotherapy of the whole pelvis at a dose of 40.4 to 50.4 and concomitant chemotherapy based on a 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine regimen. All patients underwent potentially curative radical surgery 6 to 8 weeks after preoperative chemoradiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	This study evaluated the predictive and prognostic value of expression of mismatch repair (MMR) protein, including MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 in rectal cancer patients with preoperative chemoradiotherapy.MMR protein expression was measured by immunohistochemistry in both pretreatment biopsies (pre-) and pathologic specimens (post-) from 209 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy and radical surgery. The patients were followed for a median period of 44 months.A pathologic complete response (pCR) was observed in 30 patients (14.4%). The expression levels of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 were not significantly different between the pCR and non-pCR groups. A multivariate analysis revealed that tumor differentiation, postoperative chemotherapy, and pre-MSH6 expression were independent predictors of overall survival; ypN category and perineural invasion were independent predictors of disease-free survival. The pre-MSH6 expression was significantly associated with tumor budding and expression of all MMR proteins. On multivariate analysis, ypN category and post-MSH6 expression were independent predictors for local recurrence.In our study, we observed the independent prognostic value of MSH6 expression in pretreatment tissue on overall survival and MSH6 expression after chemoradiation on local recurrence. Constitutive MSH6 expression before and after preoperative therapy may be a useful tool for prediction of oncologic outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer.

69	Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase overexpression is associated with Akt phosphorylation and indicates worse prognosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2013	23838801	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23838801	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Cases with an H score no less than the median were determined to have high NNMT or phosphorylated AKT1 expression, regardless of whether those with H scores below the median had low expression.	All 124 cases received complete courses of radiotherapy with the daily fractionation of 180-200 cGy and five fractions weekly to achieve a total dose of no less than 7,000 cGy. As a rule, at least three cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy were performed in patients with stages II-IV disease.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is overexpressed in many human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase, serving as a downstream effector of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway. NNMT was first identified as a differentially upregulated gene in nasopharyngeal cancer tissues through data mining from published transcriptomic databases. Since no prior study has attempted to evaluate the clinical significance of NNMT or phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) expression in nasopharyngeal cancer, this study explores their expression in a large cohort of patients with nasopharyngeal cancer. The study included 124 nasopharyngeal cancer patients who were free of distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Pathological slides were reviewed and clinical findings collected. We evaluated the expression of NNMT and pAkt immunohistochemically, stratified them into two groups (high and low expression) and examined the correlation with disease-specific survival (DSS), metastasis-free survival (MeFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and various clinicopathological factors. NNMT expression was significantly positively associated with pAkt expression. The high expression of both markers was significantly associated with an increment of tumor stage (p = 0.006 and p = 0.006, respectively). High expression of NNMT correlated significantly with a more aggressive clinical course and a significantly shorter DSS. Furthermore, NNMT expression and pAkt expression were strongly predictive of MeFS (p = 0.008; p = 0.0063) and LRFS (p = 0.005; p = 0.0125). In multivariate analysis, high expression of NNMT remained as a robust prognosticator for both end points evaluated. It independently portended inferior DSS (p = 0.02, HR = 1.976) and worse MeFS (p = 0.029, HR = 2.022) after tumor stage (p = 0.033, HR = 2.150; p = 0.028, HR = 2.942, for DSS and LRFS, respectively). We found NNMT positively correlated with pAkt expression and was independent adverse prognosticators of patient survival. NNMT therefore has potential utility as an indicator for prognosis, predicting treatment response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and even as a therapeutic target in the future.

62	HPV-associated p16-expression and response to hypoxic modification of radiotherapy in head and neck cancer	English	2010	19910068	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19910068	Journal Article	\N	331	238	93	60	\N	[24.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumours were classified dichotomously as either CDKN2A-positive (strong, diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmatic staining in more than 10% of carcinoma cells) or CDKN2A-negative.	The patients were treated with primary, conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (66-68 Gy in 33-34 fx, 5 fx/wk) and were randomly assigned to treatment with the hypoxic cell radiosensitiser nimorazole or placebo.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: HPV/p16-positive head and neck cancers (HNSCC) show superior response to radiotherapy, compared with virus-negative tumours. Tumour hypoxia induces radioresistance and the randomised DAHANCA 5 trial found that the hypoxic cell radiosensitiser nimorazole significantly improved the outcome in HNSCC. Using p16-status as a retrospective stratification parameter, we aimed to assess the influence of p16-expression on the response to nimorazole in HNSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-treatment tumour blocks were available from 331 of the 414 patients in the DAHANCA 5 trial and evaluated by immunohistochemistry for p16-expression. The influence of p16-expression on outcome was analysed as a function of treatment group (nimorazole/placebo) 5 years after radiotherapy. RESULTS: Overall, patients treated with nimorazole had significantly better loco-regional control than did those given placebo: hazard ratio (HR) 0.70 [95% CI 0.52-0.93]. Positive expression of p16 also significantly improved outcome after radiotherapy (0.41 [0.28-0.61]). In the subgroup of patients with p16-negative tumours, loco-regional failure was more frequent in the placebo group than in the nimorazole group (0.69 [0.50-0.95]). However, in the p16-positive group, patients treated with nimorazole had a loco-regional control rate similar to patients given placebo (0.93 [0.45-1.91]). CONCLUSIONS: HPV/p16-expression significantly improved outcome after radiotherapy in HNSCC. Hypoxic modification improved outcome in HPV/p16-negative tumours but was of no significant benefit in HPV/p16-positive tumours, suggesting that hypoxic radioresistance may not be clinically relevant in these tumours.

63	High expression of XPA confers poor prognosis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy	English	2015	26156020	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156020	Journal Article	\N	129	97	32	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	H-score that was closest to the point with both maximum sensitivity and specificity was selected as the cutoff value (H score = 1.40), and defined high XPA expression while H score ≥ 1.4 and low XPA expression while H score <1.4.	All patients were treated with chemoradiotherapy containing platinum-based regimens (at least 2 chemotherapy cycles).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	In this study, we tried to explore if xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group-A (XPA) expression is likely a prognostic prediction factor for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, which was considered to bring chemotherapy-related severe toxicity compared with radiotherapy alone. Firstly, MTT assay revealed that downregulating XPA expression in NPC HONE1 and CNE1 cells decreased IC50 of cisplatin and sensitized cells to cisplatin. XPA expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in cancer tissues from locally advanced NPC patients treated with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. The relationships between XPA expression and clinicopathologic features, overall survival and progression-free survival of patients were evaluated. The results showed that XPA expression was not associated with clinicopathologic parameters, but was likely an independent prognostic factor for patient survival. High XPA level predicts a poor prognosis, and the prediction values were higher in subgroups of younger, higher EBV antibody titer, or treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Combining XPA levels and T/N classifications, we successfully classified these patients into low, medium and high risk groups for platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. These findings suggest that XPA levels may be a potential predictor of prognosis in locally advanced NPC patients treated with platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, and helpful for selecting patients likely to need and benefit from this treatment in future.

64	Deficiency in asparagine synthetase expression in rectal cancers receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy: negative prognostic impact and therapeutic relevance	English	2014	24729124	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729124	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors with H-scores less than the median of all scored cases were classified as having low ASNS expression.	For all 172 patients with rectal cancer, radiation therapy was given at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks with 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was administered if the pretreatment (pre-Tx) or posttreatment (post-Tx) stage of the tumor was beyond T3 or N1.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Locally advanced rectal cancers are currently treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery, but risk stratification and final outcomes remain suboptimal. In this study, we identify and validate targetable metabolic drivers relevant to the prognosis of patients with rectal cancer treated with CCRT. Using a published transcriptome of rectal cancers, we found that asparagine synthetase (ASNS) gene significantly predicted the response to CCRT. From 172 patients with rectal cancer, the expression levels of ASNS, using immunohistochemistry assays, were further evaluated in tumor specimens initially obtained by using colonoscopy. Expression levels of ASNS were further correlated with major clinicopathological features and clinical survivals in this valid cohort. ASNS deficiency was significantly related to advanced posttreatment tumor (T3, T4; P = .015) and nodal status (N1, N2; P = .004) and inferior tumor regression grade (P < .001). In survival analyses, ASNS deficiency was significantly associated with shorter local recurrence-free survival (LRFS; P = .0039), metastasis-free survival (MeFS; P = .0001), and disease-specific survival (DSS; P = .0006). Furthermore, ASNS deficiency was independently predictive of worse outcomes for MeFS (P = .012, hazard ratio = 3.691) and DSS (P = .022, hazard ratio = 2.845), using multivariate analysis. ASNS deficiency is correlated with poor therapeutic response and worse survivals in patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant CCRT. These findings indicate that ASNS is a prognostic factor with therapeutic potential for treating rectal cancer.

65	Cumulative prognostic value of p53 mutations and bcl-2 protein expression in head-and-neck cancer treated by radiotherapy	English	1999	10567901	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567901	Journal Article	\N	85	76	9	62	63.5	[42.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	BCL2 expression was categorized as follows: negative if no staining was seen in tumour cells, or if only weak positive and heterogeneous staining was observed in less than 30% of the tumour cells, or positive if staining was observed in more than 30% of the cells.	All patients were irradiated with 60 Co or a 4/5-MeV linear accelerator. The daily dose ranged from 1.8 to 2.0 Gy. Patients received doses in the range 64 to 74 Gy (mean 5 70.0 Gy) to the primary. Surgical salvage was attempted in all but 3 patients with local or loco-regional radiation failure and in 5 with distant disease.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	We investigated the prognostic significance of p53-gene mutation (exon 5-9) and bcl-2-protein expression in primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) treated by curative radiotherapy (RT). Primary squamous-cell carcinomas for analysis were obtained from 85 consecutive head-and-neck-cancer patients, with complete follow-up data. We detected bcl-2 protein in 24% (20/85) of HNSCC studied; 38 (45%) of the 85 tumours had cells bearing p53 mutations. A strong association was observed between tobacco exposure and bcl-2-protein expression (p = 0.003), an association also evident in those patients who had a p53-mutated carcinoma (p = 0.049). Moreover, we found that most of the bcl-2-positive cancers (70%) were also mutated in the p53 gene (p = 0.010). In univariate and in multivariate analyses, the simultaneous detection of bcl-2 expression and a p53-gene mutation in a tumour biopsy specimen was associated with greater risk of locoregional failure (p = 0.002 and 0.001 respectively) and worse survival (p = 0. 045 and 0.033) within 5 years in HNSCC patients treated by RT. The present study shows a cumulative prognostic value of simultaneous detection of bcl-2 over-expression and p53-gene aberration in some primary HNSCC treated with conventional RT, and provides further evidence for cross-talk between p53 and bcl-2, suggesting that these genes are important determinants of radiation-induced apoptosis, thereby modulating resistance to RT.

66	Gene expression profiles of primary breast carcinomas from patients at high risk for local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy	English	2006	17020974	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17020974	Journal Article	\N	50	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Staining for ERBB2 was scored as follows: 0, no staining; 1, >10% of cells were weakly positive; 2, moderate homogeneous staining; and 3, strong homogeneous staining.	All patient were treated by BCT (breast-conserving therapy). BCT consisted of breast-conserving surgery (segmentectomy or wide local excision) followed by whole breast irradiation to a median dose of 50 Gy (range 46-52 Gy). A radiation boost to the tumor bed was delivered in 45 patients. The boost was applied by means of iridium implantation or external beam irradiation (either photons or electrons) to a median dose of 15 Gy (range 14-25 Gy). Indications for a high boost (>16 Gy) were as follows: focal involvement of tumor in the excision margin or an extensive ductal carcinoma in situ component around the tumor.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Several risk factors for local recurrence of breast cancer after breast-conserving therapy (BCT) have been identified. The identification of additional risk factors would be very useful in guiding optimal therapy and also in improving understanding of the mechanisms underlying local recurrence. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify gene expression profiles associated with local recurrence. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using 18K cDNA microarrays, gene expression profiles were obtained from 50 patients who underwent BCT. Of these 50 patients, 19 developed a local recurrence; the remaining 31 patients were selected as controls as they were free of local recurrence at least 11 years after treatment. For 9 of 19 patients, the local recurrence was also available for gene expression profiling. Unsupervised and supervised methods of classification were used to separate patients in groups corresponding to disease outcome and to study the overall gene expression pattern of primary tumors and their recurrences. RESULTS: Hierarchical clustering of patients did not show any grouping reflecting local recurrence status. Supervised analysis revealed no significant set of genes that was able to distinguish recurring tumors from nonrecurring tumors. Paired-data analysis of primary tumors and local recurrences showed a remarkable similarity in gene expression profile between primary tumors and their recurrences. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in gene expression between primary breast cancer tumors in patients with or without local recurrence after BCT were identified. Furthermore, analyses of primary tumors and local recurrences show a preservation of the overall gene expression pattern in the local recurrence, even after radiotherapy.

70	Recurrence of glioblastoma after radio-chemotherapy is associated with an angiogenic switch to the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway	English	2015	25860928	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25860928	Journal Article	\N	29	18	11	57.1000000000000014	\N	[37.2,74.1)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	First-line treatment consisted of radiotherapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) with concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/㎡ daily) followed by six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide (150 mg/㎡ up to 200 mg/㎡ for five days\nevery 28 days) for 27 of 29 patients. Two patients received BCNU (150 mg/㎡ on day 1 every 6 weeks) instead of temozolomide. At first recurrence, all patients underwent a second surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Angiogenesis is one of the key features of glioblastoma (GBM). Our objective was to explore the potential changes of angiogenic factors in GBM between initial diagnosis and recurrence after radiotherapy-temozolomide (RT/TMZ). Paired frozen tumors from both initial and recurrent surgery were available for 29 patients. Screening of genes expressions related to angiogenesis was performed using RT- PCR arrays on 10 first patients. Next, RNA expressions of the selected genes were analyzed on all samples. Protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry. The anti-tumor effect of AMD3100 (anti-CXCR4) was tested in GBM explants. In the screening step, the initial-recurrence expression changes contributed to a selection of seven genes (VEGFA, VEGFR2, VEGFR1, CXCL12, CXCR4, uPA HIF1α). By quantitative RT-PCR, RNA expressions of CXCR4 (p = 0.029) and CXCL12 (p = 0.107) were increased while expressions of HIF1α (p = 0.009) and VEGFR2 (p = 0.081) were decreased at recurrence. Similarly, CXCL12 protein expression tended to increase (p = 0.096) while VEGFR2 staining was decreased (p = 0.004) at recurrence. An increase of anti-tumoral effect was observed with the combination of AMD3100 and RT/TMZ versus RT/TMZ alone in GB explants. Recurrence of GB after chemo-radiation could be associated with a switch of angiogenic pattern from VEGFR2-HIF1α to CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway, leading to new perspectives in angiogenic treatment.

All patients received radiotherapy and chemotherapy followed by surgery. In brief, patients underwent whole pelvis preoperative radiotherapy with a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions, and then a boost of 5.4 Gy in three fractions to the primary gross tumor using 3-D conformal irradiation or four-field box technique. Four kinds of chemotherapeutic regimens commonly used in treating colorectal cancer (CRC) were proposed for the patients in the current study. Eligibility criteria for individualized protocol included age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and economic factors. Patients were grouped according to treatment protocol: 5-fluorouracil group (5-FU), radiotherapy plus continuous infusion of 5-FU (500 mg/㎡ days 1-5 and 29-33) followed by surgery and four cycles of continuous infusion of 5-FU (500 mg/㎡ days 1-5), repeated every 28 days; capecitabine group, radiotherapy plus capecitabine (850 mg/㎡ twice daily, days 1-14 and 22-35) followed by surgery and four cycles of capecitabine (1000-1250 mg/㎡ twice daily, days 1-14), repeated every 21 days; 5-FU and oxaliplatin group, radiotherapy plus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡ days 1-5 and 29-33) and oxaliplatin (85 mg/㎡ days 1 and 29) followed by surgery and eight cycles 5-FU (2400 mg/㎡ days 1-2) and oxaliplatin (100 mg/㎡ day 1), repeated every 14 days; and capecitabine and oxaliplatin group, radiotherapy plus capecitabine (850 mg/㎡ b.i.d., days 1-14 and 22-35) and oxaliplatin (85 mg/㎡ days 1 and 22) followed by surgery and four cycles of capecitabine (850-1000 mg/㎡ twice daily, days 1-14) and oxaliplatin (130 mg/㎡ day 1), repeated every 21 days.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The aim of this study was to determine whether pretreatment status of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) could predict pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) and outcomes for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). A total of 119 patients diagnosed with LARC received standardized multimodal treatment. Their HER-2 status was determined in pretreatment biopsies by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH. Tumor response was assessed in resected regimens using the tumor regression grade system and TNM staging system. Twenty-two cases in 119 patients assessed as IHC3+ or IHC2+ plus gene-amplified were determined as HER-2 positive. Positive HER-2 status was not associated with any pretreatment clinicopathologic parameters (P > 0.05). HER-2 status could not predict pathologic response to nCRT based on downstaging (P = 0.210) and tumor regression grade (P = 0.085) but it provides us with a trend that HER-2-positive tumors may be resistant to nCRT. Positive HER-2 status was significantly associated with poor 5-year disease-free survival (P = 0.015) and 5-year overall survival (P = 0.026). It can act as a worse prognostic factor for LARC patients.	Cancer Science	T3: 68 patients, T4: 51 patients. N0: 39 patients, N+: 80 patients.
72	High survivin expression as a predictor of poor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2011	21424389	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21424389	Journal Article	\N	54	46	8	59	\N	[33.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For statistical analysis, EGFR, MKI67 and CDKN1A was judged as highly expressed when >50% of tumor cells were stained. As for BIRC5, however, the cut-off value was set to the extent of more than 75%.	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy consisted of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of pelvic irradiation with concomitant chemotherapy of 5-fluorouracil (500 mg/㎡/day, intravenous bolus) or oral capecitabine (1,650 mg/㎡/day). Surgery was performed approximately 8 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate seven molecular markers including cyclooxygenase -2, epidermal growth factor receptor, Ki-67, p21, survivin, thymidylate synthase, and vascular endothelial growth factor for prediction of response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with clinical T3-4 and/or node-positive rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection were enrolled into this study. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy consisted of 50.4 Gy of pelvic irradiation with concomitant 5-fluorouracil or oral capecitabine. Expression of molecular markers in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor biopsy specimens was assessed by immunohistochemical staining on the tissue microarray. Tumor downstaging was used as an endpoint for evaluation of tumor response. RESULTS: Tumor downstaging was observed in 22 patients (41%), and pathologic complete remission in 7 patients (13%). Among seven molecular markers, only survivin expression was significantly related with tumor downstaging: 26% with high survivin expression (>75% in extent) vs. 72% with low survivin expression (p = 0.0011). However, other six molecular markers were found not to have any correlation with tumor downstaging. CONCLUSIONS: High survivin expression in pretreatment tumor biopsy was associated with less tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer.

According to the percentage of positive cells, samples with <5% positive cells were defined as negative, samples with 10-30% positive cells were weakly positive and samples with >30% positive cells were characterized as strongly positive. For VEGFA, the percentage of cells with positivity in the cytoplasm was determined, and the scoring system was: 0, negative for VEGFA; 1+, <20% positive cells; 2+, 20-50% positive staining and 3+, >50% staining. For MKI67, all stained nuclei were scored. Tumor reactivity was expressed as theMKI67 index (i.e., the number of stained tumor cells per 1,000 cells in each section). The percentage of cells showing distinct nuclear staining was determined.	The patients underwent CT simulation for three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy planning and the three-field technique (one posterior field and two lateral fields). The clinical target volume of the pre-operative radiotherapy consisted of the primary tumor, the mesentery including vascular supply and the perirectal, presacral and internal iliac nodes (up to the S1/S2 junction). The planned target area was formed by enlarging the area by 10-15 mm on the basis of the clinical target volume. Pre-operative radiotherapy was delivered in fractions of 2 Gy to reach a dose of 40 Gy at 5 fractions per week. All 40 patients received concurrent chemotherapy (300 mg/㎡ 5-FU, 200 mg/㎡ oxaliplatin and 100 mg/㎡ leucovorin) during the first 5 and last 5 days of radiotherapy. The patients received a total mesorectal excision procedure after a lengthy interval of up to 4-6 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The present study aimed to identify whether second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ki-67) expression in pre-treatment tumor biopsies are useful predictive markers of tumor response in patients with rectal cancer undergoing pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Paraffin-embedded tissues obtained before and after therapy were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for Smac, VEGF and Ki-67. The study evaluated the correlation of Smac, VEGF and Ki-67 immunoreactivity in tumor biopsies before treatment of tumor response to pre-operative CRT. Regarding Smac, patients with a favorable response to neoadjuvant CRT had higher pre-therapy levels (p=0.011). The level of Smac expression decreased after neoadjuvant therapy (p=0.044). However, VEGF expression was found to be negatively and significantly correlated with a favorable tumor response to neoadjuvant CRT (p=0.010). A transient increase in VEGF expression was detected in the resected specimens following neoadjuvant therapy (p=0.030). In addition, tumors with a low Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67-LI) expression were found to be more sensitive to neoadjuvant therapy than those with a high expression of Ki-67-LI (p=0.034). In contrast to VEGF, the Ki-67 expression level decreased after neoadjuvant therapy. Smac, VEGF and Ki-67 expression levels, assessed immunohistochemically from pre-treatment tumor biopsies, may be useful predictive markers of rectal tumor response to pre-operative CRT.

Experienced surgeons performed radical surgery, including total mesorectal excision, high vascular ligation (the inferior mesenteric artery and vein), and en bloc resection of the adjacent involved organs, at 6 to 8 weeks following the completion of preoperative chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the predictive value of a number of tissue biomarkers, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen, survivin, thymidine phosphorylase, thymidylate synthase, bax, p53, nuclear factor-kappa B, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, CD133, CD44, and cyclooxygenase-2 with regard to preoperative chemoradiation in rectal cancer. BACKGROUND: The ability to predict tumor response before treatment may significantly impact the selection of patients for preoperative chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer. However, no definite predictive marker is known. METHODS: Pretreatment biopsies from 123 patients who underwent preoperative chemoradiation were included. The mRNA levels of 13 biomarkers were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, with normalization relative to glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Response to treatment was assessed by a 4-point tumor regression grade scale based on the ratio of fibrosis to residual cancer. RESULTS: Among the 13 markers, no significant correlations in terms of T downstaging, N downstaging, and tumor-node-metastasis downstaging were observed. On multiple logistic regression analysis, only CD44 expression was found to be significant independent predictive factors for tumor regression grade response [odds ratio, 4.694 (1.155, 17.741), P = 0.030]. CD44 mRNA expression was significantly associated with expressions of the remaining 12 markers (all P < 0.05). Among the 118 patients receiving radical resection, proliferating cell nuclear antigen was the only independent factor to predict pathologic node negative status [odds ratio, 4.328 (1.078, 12.536), P = 0.037]. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CD44 mRNA levels in pretreatment biopsies might be predictive of poor tumor regression after preoperative chemoradiation in rectal cancer. Moreover, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen mRNA level might be predictive of nodal regression.	Annals of Surgery	\N
75	Clinical significance of CD133 and hypoxia inducible factor-1α gene expression in rectal cancerafter preoperative chemoradiotherapy	English	2011	20970309	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20970309	Journal Article	\N	52	42	10	65	\N	[37.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	In our institution, patients with rectal cancer (clinical stages II/III based on TNM classifications set by the International Union Against Cancer) were treated with short-course (20 Gy/four fractions) and long-course (45 Gy/25 fractions) radiotherap y using a four-field box technique with concurrent chemotherapy because of 5-fluorouracil radiosensitisation. They also underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy (intravenous infusion of 600 mg/㎡ for 24 h and tegafur-uracil given as 400 mg/㎡ orally for 5 days). This regimenwas based on the previously tested combination of continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil and oral administration of tegafur-uracil. Forty-two patients received shortcourse radiation at a dose of 20 Gy in four fractions with chemotherapy over 1 week. The remaining 10 patients received conventionally fractionated radiation at a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions with chemotherapy for 4 weeks. The time interval between preoperative CRTand surgery was 2e3 weeks in short-course irradiation patients, and 4e6 weeks in long-course irradiation patients. All patients underwent standard surgery, including total mesorectal excision, and received 5-ﬂuorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: The mechanism of distant recurrence in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has yet to be fully elucidated. Further improvements in survival rates cannot be achieved without decreasing distant recurrence after preoperative CRT. Recently, it was reported that hypoxic conditions were correlated with cancer stem cell generation. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between the expression of CD133 and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and their association with clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with rectal cancer underwent preoperative CRT. Residual cancer cells after CRT were obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens using micro-dissection. The expression levels of CD133 (PROM1) and HIF-1α genes were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between expression and irradiation was evaluated using colon cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of these proteins after CRT was also investigated. RESULTS: We observed a significant inverse correlation between the gene expression of CD133 (PROM1) and HIF-1α genes in residual cancer cells after CRT. Elevated CD133 gene expression was associated with distant recurrence and poor recurrence-free survival. Elevated HIF-1α gene expression was associated with poor overall survival. In vitro, the change in gene expression levels after irradiation showed inverse patterns. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that residual cancer cells strongly expressed CD133 and lacked HIF-1α expression. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CD133 and HIF-1α expression is associated with tumour re-growth and distant recurrence after CRT. These results may assist in clarifying the development of future cancer therapeutics in rectal cancer patients undergoing preoperative CRT.	Clinical Oncology	T1-2: 17 patients, T3-4: 35 patients.
76	Overexpression of CPS1 is an independent negative prognosticator in rectal cancers receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2014	25099619	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25099619	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	We classified tumors with H-scores no less than the median of all scored cases as those with high CPS1 expression.	All 172 patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks with 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed if the pretreatment (Pre-Tx) or posttreatment (Post-Tx) tumor or nodal status was beyond T3 or N1, respectively.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Locally advanced rectal cancers are currently treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery, but stratification of risk and final outcomes remain suboptimal. In view of the fact that glutamine metabolism is usually altered in cancer, we profiled and validated the significance of genes involved in this pathway in rectal cancers treated with CCRT. From a published transcriptome of rectal cancers (GSE35452), we focused on glutamine metabolic process-related genes (GO:0006541) and found upregulation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) gene most significantly predicted poor response to CCRT. We evaluated the expression levels of CPS1 using immunohistochemistry to analyze tumor specimens obtained during colonoscopy from 172 rectal cancer patients. Expression levels of CPS1 were further correlated with major clinicopathological features and survivals in this validation cohort. To further confirm CPS1 expression levels, Western blotting was performed for human colon epithelial primary cell (HCoEpiC) and four human colon cancer cells, including HT29, SW480, LoVo, and SW620. CPS1 overexpression was significantly related to advanced posttreatment tumor (T3, T4; P = 0.006) and nodal status (N1, N2; P < 0.001), and inferior tumor regression grade (P = 0.004). In survival analyses, CPS1 overexpression was significantly associated with shorter disease-specific survival (DSS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). Furthermore, using multivariate analysis, it was also independently predictive of worse DSS (P = 0.021, hazard ratio = 2.762) and MeFS (P = 0.004, hazard ratio = 3.897). CPS1 protein expression, as detected by Western blotting, is more abundant in colon cancer cells than nonneoplastic HCoEpiC. Overexpression of CPS1 is associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes among rectal cancer patients receiving CCRT, justifying the potential theranostic value of CPS1 for such patients.

77	Expression of carbonic anhydrase IX suggests poor outcome in rectal cancer	English	2009	19240720	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19240720	Journal Article	\N	37	24	13	65.7000000000000028	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For positive cases, the proportion of positively stained carcinoma cells was analysed using four categories: (i) 10-25%, (ii) 26-50% and (iii) over 50%. The positive slides were further evaluated to determine the staining intensity. In grading the staining intensity, three categories were used: 0 for negative, 1 for weak and 2-3 for moderate to strong staining intensity.	Thirty-seven patients were treated with long-course preoperative RT, generally by giving 50.4Gy in 6 weeks, followed by surgery in about 4-7 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The aim of the study is to assess the value of carbonic anhydrase isozyme IX (CA IX) expression as a predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in rectal cancer treated by preoperative radio- or chemoradiotherapy or surgery only. Archival tumour samples from 166 patients were analysed for CA IX expression by three different evaluations: positive/negative, proportion of positivity and staining intensity. The results of immunohistochemical analysis were confirmed by demonstrating CA IX protein in western blotting analysis. Forty-four percent of the operative samples were CA IX positive, of these 34% had weak and 66% moderate/strong staining intensity. In univariate survival analysis, intensity of CA IX expression was a predictor of DFS (P=0.003) and DSS (P=0.034), both being markedly longer in tumours with negative or weakly positive staining. In multivariate Cox model, number of metastatic lymph nodes and CA IX intensity were the only independent predictors of DFS. Carbonic anhydrase isozyme IX intensity was the only independent predictor of DSS, with HR=9.2 for dying of disease with moderate-intense CA IX expression as compared with CA IX-negative/weak cases. Negative/weak CA IX staining intensity is an independent predictor of longer DFS and DSS in rectal cancer.	British Journal of Cancer	T3: 2 patients, T4: 34 patients, Tx: 1 patients.
78	Gene expression profiles of epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 with special reference to local responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and disease recurrence after rectal cancer surgery	English	2010	20117921	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20117921	Journal Article	\N	40	31	9	\N	62.2000000000000028	[48.0,77.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	The mean valuewas used tocalculate the mRNA expression levels.	All patients have been treated with short-course radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy because of 5-FU radiosensitisation. They were treated with external irradiation (10 MV photons from a linear accelerator) using a four-field box technique and received 20 Gy in four fractions within 1 week.  They also underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulating chemotherapy (intravenous infusion of 750 mg/day 5-FU and oral administration of 400 mg/day tegafur-uracil (UFT)) over 1 week. All patients underwent standard surgery, including total mesorectum excision, after an interval of about 1 week after the completion of treatment. All patients received 5-FUbased adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: To establish a causal relationship between the gene expression profiles of angiogenetic molecular markers, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), in rectal cancer and the local responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and subsequent disease recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the pre-treatment tumour biopsies (n=40) obtained from patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (clinical International Union Against Cancer stage ll/III) who were scheduled to receive neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy for EGFR, VEGF and HIF-1 expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Responders (patients with significant tumour regression, i.e. pathological grades 2/3) showed significantly lower VEGF, HIF-1 and EGFR gene expression levels than the non-responders (patients with insignificant tumour regression, i.e. pathological grades 0/1) in the pre-treatment tumour biopsies. The elevated expression level of each gene could predict patients with a low response to chemoradiation. During the median follow-up of all patients (41 months; 95% confidence interval 28-60 months), 6/40 (15%) developed disease recurrence. Although local responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was associated with neither local nor systemic disease recurrence, lymph node metastasis and an elevated VEGF gene expression level were independent predictors of systemic disease recurrence. The 3-year disease-free survival rates of the patients with lower VEGF or EGFR expression levels were significantly lower than those of patients with higher VEGF or EGFR expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Analysing VEGF expression levels in rectal cancer may be of benefit in estimating the effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and in predicting systemic recurrence after rectal cancer surgery.

79	Predictors of tumor response after preoperative chemoradiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinomas	English	2011	21531003	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531003	Journal Article	\N	61	35	26	\N	60.5	[33.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For CA9 and GLUT1 antibodies, the percentage of stained tumor cells with strong or moderate cytoplasmic intensity was taken into account, and the cutoff value for positive expression was 50%. For CXCR4, the percentage of cells with nuclear staining was taken into account.	All patients received long-course preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with high-dose radiation therapy for 45 to 50.4 Gy for 5 to 6 weeks associated with 5 fluorouracil. Surgery was performed about 6 to 8 weeks after the end of CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The ability to predict response after chemoradiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma may allow selecting patients to whom less invasive surgical treatment could be proposed. Tumor hypoxia has been implicated in the mechanisms of resistance to chemoradiotherapy in several malignancies. The aim was to identify morphological criteria and molecular markers of hypoxia associated with chemoradiotherapy response. Clinicopathologic data from 61 patients (35 male, 60.5 ± 10 years) undergoing rectal cancer resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were collected. Pretreatment biopsies, available for 40 patients, were immunostained for hypoxia markers (carbonic anhydrase 9, glucose transporter 1, chemokine receptor 4) and microvascular density determination. Mean tumor size was 2.7 ± 1.6 cm. Twenty-one patients (34%) were considered as responders, that is, having significant or complete primary tumor regression without lymph node metastasis. Compared to other patients, responders had significantly more often flat tumors with or without ulceration (57% versus 18%, P = .01) and less vascular and/or neural invasions (9% versus 65%, P < .0001) or tumor necrosis (9% versus 41%, P < .01), respectively. Regarding pretreatment biopsies, carbonic anhydrase 9 expression was significantly lower in responders (7% versus 46%, P = .012). This study showed that tumor necrosis as an overexpression of carbonic anhydrase 9 was an effective molecular marker of postchemoradiotherapy response. This might suggest a key role of hypoxia in resistance mechanisms of chemoradiotherapy in rectal adenocarcinoma. This study highlighted the importance of predictive criteria to chemoradiotherapy response in proposing to selected patients an alternative treatment (eg, local resection) to more radical surgery.

80	O(6)-Methylguanine DNA methyltransferase determined by promoter hypermethylation and immunohistochemical expression is correlated with progression-free survival in patients with glioblastoma	English	2010	20232102	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20232102	Journal Article	\N	73	44	29	53	\N	[3.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	MGMT protein immunoreactivity was evaluated semiquantitatively by estimating the fraction of positive cells and defining <20% as low reactivity, 20-50% as moderate, and >50% as high.	All patients received adjuvant radiotherapy (total dose of 60 Gy) and chemotherapy consisting of ACNU ( Chloroethylnitrosourea such as nimustine hydrochloride) for 43 patients and TMZ ( temozolomide) for 30 patients. Twenty-three patients who received ACNU at initial therapy subsequently received TMZ at relapse. Sixty-seven patients (91.8%) underwent surgery (49 gross total resection, 18 partial or subtotal resection). Twenty-nine patients underwent second surgery or radiosurgery at first or second relapse.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: The prognostic significance of O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was evaluated by analysis of both MGMT promoter methylation and protein expression in a series of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with glioblastomas treated with alkylating agents were analyzed for MGMT expression by immunohistochemistry. Genomic DNA was isolated from frozen surgical specimens obtained from 62 of 73 patients. MGMT promoter methylation was determined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The prognostic significance of MGMT was evaluated together with other well-known prognostic factors. RESULTS: MGMT promoter hypermethylation was detected in 35 of 62 patients (56.4%). MGMT immunoreactivity was low in 26 (35.6%) tumors, moderate in 24 (32.9%), and high in 23 (31.5%). Significant correlation was observed between MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation (P < 0.001). Both MGMT promoter methylation and low MGMT expression were independently associated with better progression-free survival but not with longer overall survival. However, in the subgroup analysis, MGMT promoter hypermethylation was significantly associated with longer overall survival in patients treated with temozolomide (TMZ) after nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU) treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Low MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation are both predictive markers for slower tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma.	International Journal of Clinical Oncology	\N
81	Upregulation of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) after rectal cancer chemoradiotherapy is an adverse prognostic factor and a potential therapeutic target	English	2012	22516806	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22516806	Journal Article	\N	129	71	58	65	\N	[23.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The TFF3 immunostaining was considered positive when TFF3 was expressed inside the lumen of the tumoral microglands.	All patients received concurrent CRT (chemoradiotherapy) before surgery. Radiotherapy was uniform across all of the patients and consisted of 45 Gy followed by a boost of 5 Gy to the gross tumor volume and the mesorectum. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted mainly of fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], Tegafur-Uracil (UFT)-leucovorin, and capecitabine) or oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (raltitrexed-oxaliplatin or oxaliplatin-capecitabine). Surgery was performed 6-8 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, and total mesorectal excision was routinely performed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Management of locally advanced rectal cancer (RC) consists of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with fluoropyrimidines, followed by total mesorectal excision. We sought to evaluate the expression of selected genes, some of which were derived from a previous undirected SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression)-based approach, before and after CRT, to identify mechanisms of resistance. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 129 consecutive patients. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 53 candidate genes was performed on the biopsy specimen before treatment and on the surgical specimen after CRT. A paired-samples t test was performed to determine genes that were significantly changed after CRT. The result was correlated with patients' disease-free survival. RESULTS: Twenty-two genes were significantly upregulated, and two were significantly downregulated. Several of the upregulated genes have roles in cell cycle control; these include CCNB1IP1, RCC1, EEF2, CDKN1, TFF3, and BCL2. The upregulation of TFF3 was associated with worse disease-free survival on multivariate analyses (hazard ratio, 2.64; P=.027). Patients whose surgical specimens immunohistochemically showed secretion of TFF3 into the lumen of the tumoral microglands had a higher risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 2.51; P=.014). In vitro experiments showed that DLD-1 cells stably transfected with TFF3 were significantly less sensitive to 5-fluorouracil and showed upregulation of genes involved in the transcriptional machinery and in resistance to apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Upregulation of TFF3 after CRT for RC is associated with a higher risk of relapse. The physiological role of TFF3 in restoring the mucosa during CRT could be interfering with treatment efficacy. Our results could reveal not only a novel RC prognostic marker but also a therapeutic target.

82	Differential c-myc, c-jun, c-raf and p53 expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: implication in drug and radioresistance	English	1995	8746269	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8746269	Journal Article	\N	18	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The threshold for positive nuclear staining was based on the following features: at least 20% of clear positive tumour cells with at least two of the four antibodys tested. Only nuclear staining was taken into consideration.	18 patients received radiotherapy 60 Gy on cervical nodes area and 72 Gy on tumoral bed in 35 courses.	Radiotherapy	5	The expression of oncogenes c-myc, c-jun and c-raf and tumour suppressor gene p53 was assessed by northern blot analysis of 42 tumours and p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections from 36 specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) obtained before therapy. Of the 42 tumours, 89, 100 and 100% expressed c-myc, c-jun and c-raf oncogenes, respectively. These oncogene expressions did not correlate with sex, age or clinical stage of the disease. However, an association was found between low c-myc expression (P = 0.0001) and high c-jun expression (P = 0.0001) and absence of tumoral response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On the other hand, c-raf overexpression was observed in patients resistant to radiation therapy (P = 0.0494). Forty-two per cent of the tumours showed p53 protein overexpression, which did not correlate with any clinical parameter. This p53 protein overexpression was associated with high p53 mRNA levels (REL) (P = 0.0223). A correlation was found between increased c-myc RNA expression and lack of p53 protein expression (P = 0.0407). In addition, a lack of p53 protein expression was indicative of tumour relapse (P = 0.05). None of these biological parameters were associated with disease-free survival (Cox-Mantel test). In conclusion, the overexpression of c-myc, c-jun and c-raf may be independently associated to tumoral response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, or to tumour relapse, but fail to predict long-term survival.

83	The expression of astrocyte elevated gene-1 in human non-small-cell lung cancer and its relationship with postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy	English	2015	25913216	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913216	Journal Article	\N	62	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The percentage of positively stained cells was scored as follows: no positive cells (0), ≤10% positive cells (1), 11-50% positive cells (2), 51-75% positive cells (3) and >75% positive cells (4). The staining intensity was scored as follows: colourless (0), buff (1), brownish yellow (2) and dark brown (3). The staining intensity score multiplied by the percentage of positively stained cells was used to deﬁne the expression level of MTDH. The two groups of scores that were acquired from the two pathologists were then used for statistical analyses. Subsequently, we obtained the mean scores to calculate the median value, which was used as the cut-off point for the classiﬁcation of the patients into two groups: low expression and high expression groups.	62 patients received postoperative radiotherapy at a total dose that ranged from 50 to 66 Gy, with 2 Gy per fraction given 5 days per week.	Radiotherapy	5	AIMS: To examine the expression of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and analyse the correlation between AEG-1 expression and the prognosis of the patients, particularly the relationship between AEG-1 expression and postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy. METHODS: The expression of AEG-1 was analysed by immunohistochemistry in 225 primary NSCLC specimens and 42 adjacent normal lung tissue specimens. Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation between AEG-1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients as well as the predictive value of AEG-1. RESULTS: The expression of AEG-1 was associated with the pathological stage (P < 0.001) and lymph node status (P = 0.028). A multivariate analysis indicated that AEG-1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for both overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In the postoperative chemotherapy group, the OS (P = 0.014) and DFS (P = 0.009) in the low AEG-1 expression group were longer than the survival times in the high AEG-1 expression group. In the postoperative radiotherapy group, the local recurrence-free survival was significantly shorter in patients whose tumours showed high AEG-1 expression (P = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: AEG-1 expression could be a predictor for OS and DFS in NSCLC patients. Patients with low AEG-1 expression received the greatest benefit from both postoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

84	Molecular subclassification determined by human papillomavirus and epidermal growth factor receptor status is associated with the prognosis of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2016	26997438	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997438	Journal Article	\N	105	85	20	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an indicator of good response to chemoradiotherapy in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a molecular-therapeutic target in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Here we investigated the prevalence and prognostic significance of HPV infection and EGFR alteration in OPSCC. We analyzed the presence of high-risk HPV using in situ hybridization, protein expressions of p16 and EGFR using immunohistochemistry, and the EGFR gene copy number gain using chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in 105 cases of OPSCC. The biopsy specimens before chemoradiotherapy were used for these analyses. HPV infection and p16 protein overexpression were detected in 53.3% and 52.4% of the OPSCCs, and each factor was associated with better overall survival (P = .0026 and P = .0026) and nonkeratinizing histology (P = .0002 and P = .0004), respectively. EGFR gene copy number gain (high polysomy or amplification) was detected in 12.4% of the OPSCCs and was correlated with EGFR protein overexpression (P = .0667) and worse overall survival (P < .0001). HPV infection and EGFR gene copy number gain (EGFR CISH positive) were mutually exclusive. The HPV-negative/EGFR CISH-positive OPSCCs had significantly worse overall survival than did the HPV-positive/EGFR CISH-negative OPSCCs and HPV-negative/EGFR CISH-negative OPSCCs (P < .0001 and P < .0001, respectively). The EGFR CISH-negative OPSCCs had favorable prognosis irrespective of HPV infection. Our results suggest that EGFR gene copy number gain-positive tumors represent an HPV-negative, aggressive subgroup of OPSCCs. The molecular subclassification of OPSCCs based on HPV infection and EGFR status may serve as important information for appropriate therapeutic strategy.

85	Failure of downregulation of survivin following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in rectal canceris associated with distant metastases and shortened survival	English	2011	21118954	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21118954	Journal Article	\N	116	82	34	63	62.3999999999999986	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Intensity was scored as: 1+ (weak), 2+ (moderate), and 3+ (intense). The fraction of tumor cells with survivin positivity was assigned to: 1 (0-25%), 2 (25-50%), 3 (50-75%), and 4 (>75%). The individual labeling score for survivin results from the multiplication of staining intensity and number of positive cells, and ranges from 0 (no positive tumor cells) to 12 (>75% of tumor cells with intense staining).	All patients received a total irradiation dose of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy with concomitant application of 5-fluorouracil (73 patients;63%) or combined 5-flourouracil/oxaliplatin (43 patients; 37%) chemotherapy. Surgery was scheduled within 6 weeks after completion of RCT. Surgical procedures comprised 83 low anterior resections (72%), 32 abdomino-perineal resections (28%), and 1 discontinuous resection (Hartmann procedure), all including qualityassessed TME.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Valid molecular markers need to be implemented in clinical trials to fulfill the demand of a risk-adapted and more individualized multimodal therapy of locally advanced primary rectal cancer. In this study, the expression of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis (IAP) protein survivin was evaluated in pretreatment biopsies and corresponding posttreatment resection specimens, and was correlated to histo-pathological tumor characteristics and clinical follow-up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixteen patients with stage II/III rectal cancer treated with 5-FU-based neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) at a single university medical centre within the German Rectal Cancer Trials were investigated. Survivin expression in pretreatment biopsies and surgical resection specimens were determined by immunohistochemistry by two independent institutions and correlated with histopathologic parameters, tumor recurrences, disease-free (DFS), and overall cancer-specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: In pretreatment biopsies, a higher survivin expression correlated with advanced ypT (P = 0.026) and ypUICC (P = 0.05) stage as well as DFS (P = 0.038) after preoperative RCT. High posttreatment survivin levels were associated with advanced ypT stage (P = 0.03) and residual lymph node metastases (P = 0.04). Moreover, neoadjuvant RCT resulted in a significant downregulation of survivin expression (P < 0.0001). A failure of RCT-induced downregulation was associated with development of distant metastases (P = 0.0056) and cancer-related death (P = 0.026), and correlated significantly with DFS (P = 0.011*/0.02**) and CSS (P = 0.0017*/0.01**) in uni-* and multivariate** analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Survivin expression displays a marker with prognostic utility in rectal cancers. These results underline the potential of survivin to monitor individual response to RCT and encourage anti-survivin strategies in multimodal rectal cancer therapy within future randomized clinical trials.

86	Thymidylate synthase gene polymorphism affects the response to preoperative 5-fluorouracil chemoradiation therapy in patients with rectal cancer	English	2011	20932673	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20932673	Journal Article	\N	44	31	13	58	\N	[33.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Thymidylate synthase expression was quantitated by use of a visual grading system based on the intensity of staining, as well as its extent, i.e., focal (<25% of tumor staining positive) or diffuse (>25% of tumor staining positive). A grade of 0 to 1 was deﬁned as low intensity and 2 to 3 as high.	Preoperative CRT (chemoradiotherapy) was performed in all patients. Preoperative radiation therapy of 45 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered to the pelvis for 5 weeks (1.8 Gy/d for 5 days), followed by a 5.4-Gy boost targeted to the primary tumor via dual-photon linear accelerators with an energy of 6 or 10 MV. The following radiation ﬁeld was used: the superior border was 1.5 cm above the sacral promontory (L5 level), the inferior border was the inferior margin of the obturator foramen or 3 cm below the lower margin of the tumor, the lateral border was 1.5 cm lateral from the bony pelvis, the anterior border was 3 cm anterior to the tumor, and the posterior border was 0.5 cm posterior to the sacral surface. Two cycles of intravenous bolus injection of 5-FU (425 mg/㎡ per day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡ per day) were administered for 5 days during the ﬁrst and ﬁfth weeks of radiation therapy. All patients underwent surgery between 6 and 8 weeks after the completion of CRT. Curative resection was performed in all patients with no residual cancer. The surgical resection was classiﬁed either as low anterior resection, ultra-low anterior resection, or abdominoperineal resection.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: This study aims to correlate thymidylate synthase (TS) gene polymorphisms with the tumor response to preoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-four patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU-based preoperative CRT were prospectively enrolled in this study. Thymidylate synthase expression and TS gene polymorphisms were evaluated in tumor obtained before preoperative CRT and were correlated with the pathologic response, as assessed by histopathologic staging (pTNM) and tumor regression grade. RESULTS: Patients exhibited 2R/3R and 3R/3R tandem repeat polymorphisms in the TS gene. With regard to TS expression in these genotypes, 2R/3RC and 3RC/3RC were defined as the low-expression group and 2R/3RG, 3RC/3RG, and 3RG/3RG as the high-expression group. There was no significant correlation between TS expression and tumor response. There was no significant difference in the tumor response between patients homozygous for 3R/3R and patients heterozygous for 2R/3R. However, 13 of 14 patients in the low-expression group with a G>C single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (2R/3RC [n = 5] or 3RC/3RC [n = 9]) exhibited a significantly greater tumor downstaging rate, as compared with only 12 of 30 patients in the high-expression group without the SNP (2R/3RG [n = 10], 3RC/3RG [n = 9], or 3RG/3RG [n = 11]) (p = 0.001). The nodal downstaging rate was also significantly greater in this low-expression group, as compared with the high-expression group (12 of 14 vs. 14 of 30, p = 0.014). However, there was no significant difference in the tumor regression grade between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that SNPs within the TS enhancer region affect the tumor response to preoperative 5-FU-based CRT in rectal cancer.

87	Impact of HER2 gene and protein status on the treatment outcome of cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer	English	2008	18448999	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448999	Journal Article	\N	68	59	9	65	\N	[29.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Membrane staining intensity and patterns were evaluated by using the 0 to 3+ scale according to the HercepTest kit scoring guidelines. Scores of 0 or 1+ were considered negative for ERBB2 overexpression, a score of 2 was considered weakly positive, and a score of 3+ was considered strongly positive. To qualify for 2+ and 3+ scoring, complete membrane staining of more than 10% of tumor cells had to be observed. The results were reported as negative (score 0 to 1+) or positive (score 2+ to 3+).	Treatment in the ﬁrst study (OLCSG 9404) consisted of three cycles of 5-ﬂuorouracil (500 mg/㎡ , days 1-5) and cisplatin (20 mg/㎡ , days 1-5) every 4 weeks, and concurrent hyperfractionated radiotherapy (1.25 Gy twice daily, total dose: 62.5-70 Gy). In the second study (OLCSG 9707), treatment comprised a com- bination of docetaxel 40 mg/㎡ and cisplatin 40 mg/㎡ given on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 with concurrent radiotherapy (2 Gy daily, total 60 Gy).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: It has not been fully evaluated whether both HER2 gene copy number and HER2 protein expression are related to the outcome of chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). The aim of this study was to evaluate their relationships. METHODS: HER2 gene copy number determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and HER2 protein expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were assessed in 68 patients with LA-NSCLC enrolled in our previous phase II trials of concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy, and a multivariate analysis was conducted for response and survival. RESULTS: HER2-IHC-positive tumors were detected in 23 patients (34%), and the median ratio of HER2 to chromosome 17 copy number was 0.93 (range, 0.55-2.00). The HER2-FISH results were marginally correlated with the IHC results (p = 0.0715). When the median ratio in the FISH analysis was used as a cut-off level for its positivity, there was no association between either HER2-FISH or IHC status and objective response to chemoradiotherapy. Contrary, a multivariate analysis revealed HER2-FISH result but not IHC result was an independent poor prognostic factor for both overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 2.568, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.117-5.903, p = 0.0264 and hazard ratio = 2.283, 95% CI = 1.005-5.189, p = 0.0487, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with HER2 FISH-positive LA-NSCLC had a poorer outcome even when treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy, despite the strong need for validation assessment of these observations. Development of more effective treatment for these high-risk patients is needed to improve their poor prognosis.	Journal of Thoracic Oncology	Stage IIIA: 16 patients, Stage IIIB: 52 patients.
88	The prognostic impact of lipid biosynthesis-associated markers, HSD17B2 and HMGCS2, in rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2015	25929810	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25929810	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	To further validate the expression of these two markers, the immunohistochemical results were categorized as low, medium, and high expression based on three partitioning of the H-scores.	All 172 patients received radiation therapy with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions during a period of 5 weeks, as well as 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concurrently before surgery. In addition, patients with tumor status of T3 to T4 or with positive nodal status, either in the pre-treatment (Pre-Tx) or post-treatment (Post- Tx) condition, further received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been widely used for rectal cancer to improve local tumor control. The varied response of individual tumors encouraged us to search for useful biomarkers to predict the therapeutic response. The study was aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of lipid biosynthesis-associated biomarkers in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Through analysis of the previously published gene expression profiling database focusing on genes associated with lipid biosynthesis, we found that HSD17B2 and HMGCS2 were the top two significantly upregulated genes in the non-responders. We further evaluated their expression by immunohistochemistry in the pre-treatment tumor specimens from 172 patients with rectal cancer and statistically analyzed the associations between their expression and various clinicopathological factors, as well as survival. High expression of HMGCS2 or HSD17B2 was significantly associated with advanced pre- and post-treatment tumor or nodal status (P < 0.001) and lower tumor regression grade (P < 0.001). More importantly, high expression of either HMGCS2 or HSD17B2 was of prognostic significance, with HMGCS2 overexpression indicating poor prognosis for disease-free survival (P = 0.0003), local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0115), and metastasis-free survival (P = 0.0119), while HSD17B2 overexpression was associated with poor prognosis for disease-free survival (P <0.0001), local recurrence-free survival (P = 0.0009), and metastasis-free survival (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, only HSD17B2 overexpression remained as an independent prognosticator for shorter disease-free survival (P < 0.001) and metastasis-free survival (P = 0.008). In conclusion, high expression of either HSD17B2 or HMGCS2 predicted poor susceptibility of rectal cancer to preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Both acted as promising prognostic factors, particularly HSD17B2.	Tumor Biology	T1-2: 81 patients, T3-4: 91 patients; N0: 125 patients, N1-2: 47 patients.
89	BRCA1 mRNA expression as a predictive and prognostic marker in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with cisplatin- or docetaxel-based chemotherapy/chemoradiotherapy	English	2013	23326344	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23326344	Journal Article	\N	72	45	27	\N	\N	[44.0,79.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	The other 76 patients with locally advanced disease received cisplatin or docetaxel-based concurrent chemoradiother- apy (CCRT) or radiotherapy alone as the first-line treatment. CCRT included chemotherapy and concurrent thoracic radio- therapy. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of weekly docetaxel (25 mg/㎡ on day 1 per week) plus 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/㎡ on day 1-3 per week) or cisplatin (25 mg/㎡ on day 1 per week) plus 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/㎡ on day 1-3 per week) for 5 weeks. The radiation dose was 50-60 grays (Gy) over 5 weeks (2 Gy/fraction per day, 5 fractions per week) with the use of CT simulation and 3 D treatment planning. Baseline and restaging assessment of measurable lesions were assessed by barium swallow and computed tomography scans, which was repeated every 2 cycle of chemotherapy or 4 weeks after radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The molecular backgrounds that determine therapeutic effectiveness in esophageal cancer remain largely unknown. Breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) expression has been found to switch the response to cisplatin- or paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. It remains unclear how variations in BRCA1 expression influence clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to examine BRCA1 mRNA expressions in paraffin-embedded specimens from 144 patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received cisplatin- or docetaxel-based first-line treatments. RESULTS: Low BRCA1 mRNA expression correlated with increased response rate (RR; P = 0.025 and 0.017, respectively) and median overall survival (mOS; P = 0.002 and P<0.001, respectively) in cisplatin-based chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy group and also correlated with decreased RR (P = 0.017 and 0.024, respectively) and mOS (both P<0.001) in docetaxel-based chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy group. Multivariate analysis revealed that low BRCA1 expression was an independent prognostic factor in cisplatin-based chemotherapy (HR 0.29; 95%CI 0.12-0.71; P = 0.007) or chemoradiotherapy (HR 0.12; 95%CI 0.04-0.37; P<0.001) group and higher risk for mortality in docetaxel-based chemotherapy (HR 5.02; 95%CI 2.05-12.28; P<0.001) or chemoradiotherapy (HR 7.02; 95%CI 2.37-27.77; P<0.001) group. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA1 mRNA expression could be used as a predictive and prognostic marker in esophageal cancer who underwent first-line cisplatin- or docetaxel-based treatments.

90	PLA2G2A overexpression is associated with poor therapeutic response and inferior outcome in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2015	25393083	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393083	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	We classiﬁed tumours with H-scores no less than the median of all scored cases as those with high PLA2G2A expression.	All 172 patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a 5-week period with 24-h continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed for those with either pretreatment (pre-Tx) or post-treatment (post-Tx) tumour status of T3-T4 or with positive nodal status.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of group IIA phospholipase A2 (PLA2G2A) expression and its role in predicting the response to neoadjuvant concurrent cheomoradiotherapy (CCRT) in rectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Through analysing a public transcriptome of rectal cancers, the PLA2G2A gene was identified as a significant predictor for CCRT response. We validated the expression of PLA2G2A using immunohistochemistry in the pretreatment tumour specimens from 172 patients with rectal cancer. The results were correlated with clinicopathological features, tumour regression grade, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). High expression of PLA2G2A was associated with advanced pretreatment tumour status (P = 0.001), advanced pretreatment nodal status (P = 0.010), advanced post-treatment tumour status (P = 0.002) and lower tumour regression grade (P = 0.006). Furthermore, PLA2G2A expression was correlated negatively with gamma H2A histone family, member X (γ-H2AX) expression (P < 0.001, r = -0.580). More importantly, high expression of PLA2G2A emerged as an adverse prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.0190), DFS (P < 0.0001) and LRFS (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, it remained independently prognostic for shorter DFS (P = 0.014) and LRFS (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of PLA2G2A was associated with poor therapeutic response and worse survival in patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant CCRT, justifying PLA2G2A as an important marker to predict CCRT response and outcome.

443	DNA-PKcs expression predicts response to radiotherapy in prostate cancer	English	2012	22494583	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22494583	Journal Article	\N	238	238	\N	71	\N	[49.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For PRKDC, because of a concomitant cytoplasmic staining, staining was classified into 2 categories: 0, the absence of nuclear staining; or +, positive nuclear staining.	We selected 238 patients treated with curative intent by exclusive external beam radiotherapy (without hormonal therapy).	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Double-strand breaks, the most lethal DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation, are mainly repaired by the nonhomologous end-joining system. The expression of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway has never been studied in prostate cancer, and its prognostic value for patients undergoing radiotherapy remains unknown. METHODS: Pretreatment biopsies from 238 patients treated with exclusive external beam radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer with ≥ 2 years of follow-up were reviewed to reassess the Gleason score. Of these 238 cases, 179 were suitable for in situ analysis and were included in the tissue microarrays. Expression of the nonhomologous end-joining proteins Ku70, Ku80, DNA-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunits (DNA-PKcs), and X-ray repair cross complementing 4-like factor was studied by immunohistochemistry, together with the proliferation marker Ki67. RESULTS: The predictive value of the Gleason score for biochemical relapse (using the Phoenix criteria) was markedly improved after review (P<.0001) compared with the initial score (P=.003). The clinical stage, pretreatment prostate-specific antigen level, and perineural invasion status were also associated with progression-free survival (P=.005, P<.0001, and P=.03, respectively). High proliferation (>4%) tends to be associated with biochemical recurrence; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=.06). Although the expression of Ku70, Ku80, and X-ray repair cross complementing 4-like factor was not predictive of relapse, positive DNA-PKcs nuclear staining was closely associated with biochemical recurrence (P=.0002). On multivariate analysis, only the Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen level, and DNA-PKcs status remained predictive of recurrence (P=.003, P=.002, and P=.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study highly suggest that DNA-PKcs could be a predictive marker of recurrence after radiotherapy, independently of the classic prognostic markers, including the Gleason score modified after review.

Radiotherapy was delivered with 6-MV linear accelerators using two opposed lateral fields. The treatment dose ranged fro㎡ to 2.1 Gy per fraction per day, and the median total dose was 63 Gy (range, 60-70).	Radiotherapy	5	AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effect of bcl-2 expression on the local control and overall survival of patients with early stage laryngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy alone. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We included 53 patients with stage Tis, T1, and T2 laryngeal cancer who were irradiated in our department. Paraffin blocks of all biopsy specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis with a bcl-2 oncoprotein mouse clone 124 Scytek kit. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 61 months (range, 7-166). Local-regional recurrence was observed in 10 (19%) patients. Forty-three patients (81%) had negative bcl-2 staining, 5 patients (9%) had + staining, 3 patients (6%) ++ staining, and 2 patients (4%) +++ staining. No relationship was detected between bcl-2 expression and local control or overall survival. The emergence of a recurrence and a younger age (<50 years) were significantly related to poor overall survival (P = 0.000 and P = 0.021, respectively). Patients with hemoglobin levels in the middle of radiotherapy and at the end of radiotherapy higher than 13 g/dl had improved overall survival in multivariate analyses (P = 0.002 and P = 0.001, respectively). Regarding local control, the following were poor prognostic factors: smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day (P = 0.001) and being younger than 50 years of age (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: No correlation was observed between bcl-2 expression and local control or overall survival. Whereas hemoglobin level, age and existence of a recurrence had a prognostic impact on overall survival, patient age and smoking status influenced local control rates.

92	Tumor aromatase expression as a prognostic factor for local control in young breast cancerpatients after breast-conserving treatment	English	2009	19638208	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638208	Journal Article	\N	257	\N	257	37	\N	[23.0,40.0)	Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	Surgery consisted of breast-conserving procedures as first-line treatment in all cases. The quality of the surgical margins was classified as wide (more than 3 mm) in 32 (65%) patients, close (3 mm or less) in 11 (22%) patients, involved with ductal carcinoma in situ in 2 (4%) patients, involved with invasive carcinoma in 4 (8%) patients, and unknown in 4 patients. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed in all patients. Patients received posttumorectomy radiotherapy with a median dose of 51 Gy (range, 45 to 54 Gy) to the breast. A boost to the tumor bed was performed for 40 (75%) of patients with a median dose of 16 Gy (range, 7 to 25 Gy). The median total dose to the tumor bed was 66 Gy (range, 50 to 75 Gy). Supraclavicular irradiation was performed in 27 (51%) of patients. Internal mammary irradiation was performed in 38 (72%) of patients. In the case of lymph node involvement, the internal mammary chain and the supraclavicular area were both irradiated. In the absence of lymph node involvement, irradiation of the internal mammary chain, with or without the supraclavicular area, was indicated for centrally located tumors with histopathologic features of aggressiveness. Axillary irradiation was added in the presence of extensive axillary involvement or in the absence of axillary lymph node dissection. No protocol to boost all young patients with negative surgical margins was available at that time, and some patients reported in this series were accrued in the EORTC boost trial that randomized between boost and no boost from 1989 to 1996. In the case of positive surgical margins, a radiotherapy boost of generally 20 to 28 Gy was added to the whole-breast irradiation. For patients not participating in the EORTC randomized trial, a boost of 10 to 16 Gy was added in the case of aggressive histopathologic features (unsatisfactory margins, high histopathologic grade, high proliferation index, absence of hormone receptors).	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: We sought to determine whether the levels of expression of 17 candidate genes were associated with locoregional control after breast-conserving treatments of early-stage breast cancers in young, premenopausal women. METHODS: Gene expression was measured by using RT-PCR in the breast tumors of a series of 53 young (younger than 40 years), premenopausal patients. All treatments consisted of primary breast-conserving surgery followed by whole-breast radiotherapy (+/- regional lymph nodes) with or without systemic treatments (chemotherapy +/- hormone therapy). The median follow-up was 10 years. RESULTS: The 10-year locoregional control rate was 70% (95% CI, 57% to 87%). In univariate analysis, no clinical/pathologic prognostic factors were found to be significantly associated with decreased locoregional control. Expression of three genes was found to be significantly associated with an increased locoregional recurrence rate: low estrogen-receptor beta, low aromatase, and high GATA3. Two others were associated with only a trend (P < 0.10): low HER1 and SKP2. In multivariate analysis, only the absence of aromatase was significantly associated with an increased locoregional recurrence rate (P = 0.003; relative risk = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Recent data give credit to the fact that breast cancer in young women is a distinct biologic entity driven by special oncogenic pathways. Our results highlight the role of estrogen-signaling pathways (mainly CYP19/aromatase, GATA3, and ER-beta) in the risk of locoregional recurrence of breast cancer in young women. Confirmation in larger prospective studies is needed.	Breast Cancer Research	T0-1: 186 patients, T2: 71 patients; N0: 246 patients, N1: 11 patients.
93	p16INK4a Status and Response to Induction Low-Dose Fractionated Radiation in Advanced Head and Neck Cancer	English	2015	25810339	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25810339	Journal Article	\N	42	35	7	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors were classified as positive when >75% showed diffuse nuclear and cystoplasmic staining.	As previously reported, both protocols used 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) with 4 fractions of LDFRT (Induction therapy with low-dose fractionated radiotherapy). The total induction dose of LDFRT was 640 cGy for HN11 and 800 cGy for HN15. The patients then went on to definitive treatment. The total radiation dose for patients undergoing definitive radiation therapy ranged from 66 to 70 Gy. Surgical pathology slides from initial tumor biopsies before therapy were collected for immunohistochemical evaluation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of p16INK4a (p16) expression on clinical efficacy of induction low-dose fractionated radiation therapy (LDFRT) with concurrent chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary medical center. METHODS: A total of 66 Patients with locally advanced SCCHN were enrolled in 2 clinical trials using paclitaxel, carboplatin, and concurrent LDFRT induction therapy. Patients were evaluated for response to induction by a multidisciplinary team and then were given definitive treatment. Adequate tissue samples from the pretreatment biopsies of 42 individuals were identified and analyzed for p16 expression. Expression was correlated with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 42 tumors, 15 (35.7%) were positive for p16. Patients with p16-positive tumors had improved response to induction, but this was not statistically significant (P = .06). Five-year overall survival was 80% in p16-positive patients and 58% in p16-negative patients (P = .025). CONCLUSIONS: p16 Expression affects treatment response in patients treated with induction LDFRT with concurrent chemotherapy. This is similar to results reported for standard induction chemotherapy.

94	Abnormal bcl-2 and pRb expression are independent correlates of radiation response in muscle-invasive bladder cancer	English	1997	9815569	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9815569	Journal Article	\N	107	82	25	62	61	[35.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy was delivered using a four-field technique with 18-MV photons to a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The radiation was given over 5 weeks, and 4-6 weeks later, radical cystetomy was performed.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The objective of this study was to determine whether the overexpression of bcl-2, a key protein governing the apoptotic response to radiation, adds to pRb status in estimating the propensity for radiation response in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, pretreatment bladder tumor samples were available in 109 of 301 patients treated preoperatively with 50 Gy in 25 fractions followed by radical cystectomy 4-6 weeks later. Radiation response was assessed by clinical-to-pathological tumor downstaging or upstaging. Altered expression of bcl-2 (47% of 107 patients), p53 (56% of 109 patients), and pRb (30% of 98 patients) was assessed by immunohistochemical staining. Morphological criteria were used to calculate the percentage of apoptotic cells. bcl-2 staining correlated with tumor grade; all grade 2 tumors (n = 7) displayed normal bcl-2 expression (negative staining). No correlations between bcl-2 staining and pretreatment apoptosis levels, p53 staining, and pRb staining were observed. In terms of the radiation response parameters, univariate analyses revealed that bcl-2 overexpression was the only factor associated with upstaging. The main predictor of downstaging was the loss of pRb expression (negative staining). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed these findings and also showed that normal pRb expression (positive staining) was significantly related to upstaging. Patient outcome was adversely affected by bcl-2 overexpression, because these patients experienced significantly increased actuarial local failure rates. No difference in distant metastasis or survival rates by bcl-2 staining was seen. The strongest independent correlates of radiation response thus far identified in muscle-invasive bladder cancer are from bcl-2 and pRb immunohistochemical staining. The overexpression of bcl-2 and the normal expression of pRb seem to thwart the apoptotic response to radiation via independent mechanisms. Abnormalities in the expression of proteins that regulate apoptosis may prove to establish a molecular phenotype to characterize which patients should receive radiotherapy.

All patients received external beam radiotherapy using 10 MV X-rays with an opposed 2-portal technique. The initial treatment volume included the primary tumor with proximal and distal margins of 3.0 cm and a radial margin of 1.0-1.5 cm, as well as enlarged lymph nodes. Treatment schedule A consisted of a continuous infusion of 5-FU 400 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 and 8-12 combined with CDDP (cisplatin) 40 mg/㎡ on days 1 and 8; concurrent radiotherapy at 2 Gy/day was given on weekdays (days 1-5, 8-12 and 15-19), with a 2-week break after cumulative irradiation of 30 Gy, and was restarted on day 36 at the same schedule. The total radiation dose was 60 Gy. Treatment schedule B consisted of continuous infusion of 5-FU 700 mg/㎡/day on days 1-4 and 29-32 combined with CDDP 70 mg/㎡ on days 1 and 29; concurrent radiotherapy was given at 2 Gy/day on weekdays (days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33 and 36-40). The total radiation dose was 60 Gy. Additional chemotherapy, consisting of continuous infusion of 5-FU 800 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 combined with CDDP 80 mg/㎡ on day 1, was administered 2 times every 4 weeks in patients who showed any response other than definite progression to CRT. Additional chemotherapy courses, limited to a total of 4 courses, were optional.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a possible alternative to surgery for esophageal cancer. As complete response (CR) to CRT is essential for a good prognosis, potential biomarkers predictive of CR were explored. METHODS: Endoscopic tumor biopsies were obtained from 41 patients with stage II-III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma before 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin-based definitive CRT. cDNA was derived from RNA isolated from microdissected tumor cells. mRNA expression levels of 10 genes involved in CRT or tumor biology were measured using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Expression levels of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT) and dihydrofolate reductase mRNA were significantly higher in the CR group compared with the non-CR group (p = 0.0206 and 0.0191, respectively). Matrix metalloproteinase 9 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the CR group (p = 0.0436). CR rates were significantly higher in patients with node-negative disease and high expression levels of OPRT and dihydrofolate reductase genes (p = 0.0448, 0.0104 and 0.0104, respectively). No significant difference in CR rates was observed for other variables. Multivariate analysis revealed that high OPRT gene expression was an independent predictive factor of CR (p = 0.0192). It was also significantly associated with good prognosis (p = 0.0450). CONCLUSION: High OPRT gene expression may be a predictive factor of CR to 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin-based CRT in esophageal cancer.	Oncology	Stage II: 12 patients, Stage III: 29 patients.

Preoperatively, radiation therapy was given to all patients at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks with 24 h continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil concurrently.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIMS: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery is an increasingly used therapeutic strategy for advanced rectal cancer, but risk stratification and final outcomes remain suboptimal. Recently, the oncogenic role of the fibroblast growth factor/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway has been recognised; however, its clinical significance in rectal cancer has not been elucidated. In this study, we identify and validate targetable drivers associated with the FGFR signalling pathway in rectal cancer patients treated with CCRT. METHODS: Using a published transcriptome of rectal cancers, we found FGFR2 gene significantly predicted response to CCRT. The expression levels of FGFR2, using immunohistochemistry assays, were further evaluated in 172 rectal cancer specimens that had not received any treatment. Expression levels of FGFR2 were statistically correlated with major clinicopathological features and clinical survival in this valid cohort. RESULTS: High expression of FGFR2 was significantly related to advanced pretreatment tumour (p=0.022) and nodal status (p=0.026), post-treatment tumour (p<0.001) and nodal status (p=0.004), and inferior tumour regression grade (p<0.001). In survival analyses, high expression of FGFR2 was significantly associated with shorter local recurrence-free survival (p=0.0001), metastasis-free survival (MeFS; p=0.0003) and disease-specific survival (DSS; p<0.0001). Notably, high expression of FGFR2 was independently predictive of worse outcomes for MeFS (p=0.002, HR=5.387) and DSS (p=0.004, HR=4.997). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of FGFR2 is correlated with advanced tumour stage, poor therapeutic response and worse survival in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT. These findings indicate that FGFR2 is a prognostic factor for treating rectal cancer.	Journal of Clinical Pathology	T1-2: 81 patients, T3-4: 91 patients; N0: 125 patients, N1-2: 47 patients.
97	Overexpression of REG4 confers an independent negative prognosticator in rectal cancersreceiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2014	25155043	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25155043	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	We classiﬁed tumors with H‐scores no less than the median of all scored cases as those with high REG4 expression.	All 172 patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of ﬁve weeks with 24 hr continuous infusion of 5‐ﬂuorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed if the pre‐treatment (Pre‐Tx) or post‐treatment (Post‐Tx) tumor or nodal status was beyond T3 or N1, respectively.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Through data mining from published transcriptomic database, we identified Regenerating Gene Type IV (REG4) as the most significantly associated gene with resistance to CCRT. This study examined the prognostic impact of REG4 expression in patients with rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant CCRT. METHODS: REG4 immunohistochemistry was retrospectively assessed for pre-treatment biopsy specimens from 172 rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery without initial distant metastasis. The results were correlated with the clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), as well as γ-H2AX expression in post-treatment tumor samples. RESULTS: High expression of REG4 was associated with advanced pre-treatment nodal status (P = 0.026), advanced post-treatment tumor status (P = 0.006), advanced post-treatment nodal status (P = 0.001), advanced post-treatment tumor stage (P < 0.001), and inferior tumor regression grade (P = 0.001). Of note, high expression of REG4 emerged as an adverse prognosticator for DSS (P = 0.0004), LRFS (P = 0.0009), and MeFS (P = 0.0254). After multivariate comparisons, it remained independently prognostic for worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.731; P = 0.025) and LRFS (HR = 2.676; P = 0.029). High expression of REG4 was also negatively associated with γ-H2AX expression (P < 0.0001, r = -0.708). CONCLUSIONS: High expression of REG4 is associated with poor therapeutic response, adverse outcome and an aggressive phenotype in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT, justifying REG4 is a surrogate marker to predict CCRT resistance.

98	p53 status and prognosis of locally advanced prostatic adenocarcinoma: a study based on RTOG 8610	English	1997	8998185	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8998185	Journal Article	\N	129	129	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For the statistical analysis, specimens with fewer than 20% positive nuclei were considered to have normal TP53 expression, and specimens with 20% or more positive nuclei were considered to have abnormal expression.	57 treated with radiotherapy plus hormone therapy and 72 treated with radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: The p53 tumor suppressor gene (also known as TP53) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer. Several studies have shown that p53 mutations are infrequent in prostate cancer and are associated with advanced disease. PURPOSE: We assessed the prognostic value of identifying abnormal p53 protein expression in the tumors of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who were treated with either external-beam radiation therapy alone or total androgen blockade before and during the radiation therapy. METHODS: The study population consisted of a subset of patients entered in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 8610 ("a phase III trial of Zoladex and flutamide used as cytoreductive agents in locally advanced carcinoma of the prostate treated with definitive radiotherapy"). Immunohistochemical detection of abnormal p53 protein in pretreatment specimens (i.e., needle biopsies or transurethral resections) was achieved by use of the monoclonal anti-p53 antibody DO7; specimens in which 20% or more of the tumor cell nuclei showed positive immunoreactivity were considered to have abnormal p53 protein expression. Associations between p53 protein expression status and the time to local progression, the incidence of distant metastases, progression-free survival, and overall survival were evaluated in univariate (logrank test) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards model) analyses. Reported P values are two-sided. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine (27%) of the 471 patients entered in the trial had sufficient tumor material for analysis. Abnormal p53 protein expression was detected in the tumors of 23 (18%) of these 129 patients. Statistically significant associations were found between the presence of abnormal p53 protein expression and increased incidence of distant metastases (P = .04), decreased progression-free survival (P = .03), and decreased overall survival (P = .02); no association was found between abnormal p53 protein expression and the time to local progression (P = .58). These results were independent of the Gleason score and clinical stage. A significant treatment interaction was detected with respect to the development of distant metastases: Among patients receiving both radiation therapy and hormone therapy, those with tumors exhibiting abnormal p53 protein expression experienced a reduced time to the development of distant metastases (P = .001); for patients treated with radiation therapy alone, the time to distant metastases was unrelated to p53 protein expression status (P = .91). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of p53 protein expression status yield significant, independent prognostic information concerning the development of distant metastases, progression-free survival, and overall survival for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who are treated primarily with radiation therapy. IMPLICATIONS: The interaction of radiation therapy plus hormone therapy and abnormal p53 protein expression may provide a clinical link to experimental evidence that radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy act, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis (a cell death program) and suggests that this mechanism may be blocked in patients whose tumors have p53 mutations.

99	DNA repair pathways to regulate response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer	English	2016	27465548	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27465548	Journal Article	\N	32	29	3	\N	61.1599999999999966	[44.0,79.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	For each biomarker, two categories are defined based on the median value of biomarker mRNA expression: < median if expression value is less than the median, i.e., <Q 50, and > median if expression value is greater than or equal to the median, i.e., >Q 50.	All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy schedule was weekly carboplatin AUC 2; 83 % received conventional and 17 % hyperfractionated radiotherapy (a large volume encompassing the primary site and all draining lymph nodes received a dose of 70 Gy, and the dose to the spinal cord was limited to 60 Gy and to the supraclavicular area to 50 Gy). Salvage cervical surgery was performed in 17 % of patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is a preferred standard of care for locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). However, survival benefit is small, with substantial toxicity and biomarkers of CRT resistance that could guide treatment selection and spare morbidity. Increased DNA repair in solid tumors may contribute to cancer cells' ability to survive in genotoxic stress environments afforded by therapy. We assessed mRNA expression levels of DNA repair-related genes BRCA1, RAP80, 53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), and RNF8. We correlated our findings with response and overall survival in 72 head and neck patients treated with weekly carboplatin AUC 2 and radiotherapy. Complete response (CR) to CRT was 50 % in patients with low levels of 53BP1 compared to 6.3 % in patients with high levels (p = 0.0059). Of high BRCA1 mRNA expressors, 41.2 % had CR compared to 29.4 % of low expressors (p = 0.72). For a small group of patients with low 53BP1 and either high BRCA1 or RAP80, CRs were 66.7 and 71.4 %, respectively. A trend for better overall survival (OS) was found for patients with low 53BP1 (15 vs 8 m; p = 0.056). Our findings highlight the potential usefulness of 53BP1 mRNA as a predictive biomarker of response and overall survival in HNC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Those with high 53BP1 expression could derive only a meager benefit from treatment. Analysis of BRCA1 and RAP80 could further reinforce the predictive value of 53BP1. Although this was a retrospective study with small sample size, it could inform larger translational studies in HNC.

100	P63 and EGFR as prognostic predictors in stage IIB radiation-treated cervical squamous cell carcinoma	English	2003	14599865	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14599865	Journal Article	\N	84	\N	84	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	To determine the significance of TP63 and EGFR, we used 15% nuclear staining for TP63, and 0% for EGFR and apoptosis as a cut-off value.	Briefly, the patients received three cycles of chemotherapy given concomitantly during Weeks 1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens involved combinations of cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cisplatin was given as a daily bolus dose of 100 mg/㎡, and 5-FU was administered as a 24-h continuous infusion at 1000 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days. Radiotherapy was delivered by a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation using a remote afterloading system incorporating an iridium-192 source (Gamma-Med II). External whole-pelvis irradiation was performed with at 1.8 Gy per fraction five times per week to a midline dose of 27.0-36.0 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation with six insertions (twice per week) with a fractional dose of 5.0 Gy to a total dose of 30.0 Gy at point A. The patients then received a second course of external irradiation with central shielding up to a total external dose of 45.0-50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the relation between p63, p53-related gene, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and spontaneous apoptosis in relation to radiotherapy in patients with FIGO stage IIB cervical carcinoma, who had undergone radiation and concurrent chemotherapy, retrospectively. METHODS: Eighty-four patients with FIGO stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix, who were treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy between 1991 and 1996, were included in the present study. The clinicopathologic features, patterns of treatment failure, and survival data were compared with the expressions of p63 and EGFR, which were determined by immunohistochemistry and with apoptosis by TUNEL on tissue-arrayed slides. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors that influence patient survival. RESULTS: Overall the indices of the expressions of p63 and EGFR in stage IIB cervical carcinoma were 18.7 and 26.6%, respectively, and these were found to be correlated. EGFR expression was significantly associated with extrapelvic failure (P = 0.03), whereas p63 was associated with locoregional failure (P = 0.03). The spontaneous apoptotic index showed no prognostic value, but the immunoreactivities of p63 and EGFR were associated with a worse prognosis by both univariate (P = 0.01 and 0.04, respectively) and multivariate analysis (95% CI:2.0-4.4, RR:3.2 and 95% CI:4.9-8.7, RR:6.7, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The expression of p63 gene is associated with poor survival and locoregional failure, whereas EGFR expression was found to be a prognostic predictor of extrapelvic failure. Both molecules were found to be potent molecular risk factors in patients with FIGO stage IIB SCC of the uterine cervix, who had received radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.

101	Endogenous markers of two separate hypoxia response pathways (hypoxia inducible factor 2 alpha and carbonic anhydrase 9) are associated with radiotherapy failure in head and neck cancer patients recruited in the CHART randomized trial	English	2006	16418497	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16418497	Journal Article	\N	198	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The same cutoff point (< 10% v ≥ 10%) was used to deﬁne two groups of tumors with low/negative and high/positive CA9 reactivity.	Out of these 198 patients, 116 were treated with CHART (1.5 Gy X 3 per day,for 12 days: 54 Gy total dose)and 82 with conventional radiotherapy (2Gy per day, 33 fractions: 66 Gy total dose).	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Randomized controlled trials have generally shown a benefit from accelerated radiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the large randomized United Kingdom trial CHART (Continuous Hyperfractionated Accelerated Radiotherapy) failed to show a benefit of strongly accelerated over standard radiotherapy (RT) in 918 patients with HNSCC. In this study, we investigated the impact of tumor hypoxia on the outcome of HNSCC patients in the CHART trial. There are two distinct hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) that control different gene response pathways and we assessed them both with endogenous markers of hypoxia, hypoxia inducible factor HIF-2 alpha (HIF-2) and carbonic anhydrase CA9, an indicator of HIF-1 alpha (HIF-1) function. METHODS: Tissue from pre-RT biopsies performed in 198 of 918 patients recruited was analyzed for the immunohistochemical expression of HIF-2 and CA9. RESULTS: A significant association of high HIF2 and of high CA9 reactivity with poor locoregional control (P < .0001 and P = .0002, respectively) and poor survival (P = .0004 and 0.002, respectively) was noted. In multivariate analysis, HIF-2 and CA9 maintained their independent prognostic significance. Coexpression of both pathways had an additive effect, supporting their independent role. The uni-directional hypothesis, that a benefit from randomization to CHART should be seen in the nonhypoxic tumors, was supported by the data (one-tailed P = .04). CONCLUSION: Expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia for the HIF-1 and HIF-2 pathway is strongly associated with radiotherapy failure. Using immunohistochemical methods it is possible to identify subgroups of HNSCC patients who are highly curable with radiotherapy, or who are excellent candidates for clinical trials on hypoxia-targeting drugs in two distinct pathways.

Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple-field technique. Standardized transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy was performed 4-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIMS: Neoadjuvant treatment strategies have been developed to improve the survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Since only patients with major histopathological response benefit from multimodality treatment, we profiled the genome of patients with esophageal cancer for markers indicating response or nonresponse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment biopsies of responding and nonresponding patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, as well as the corresponding normal epithelium, were analyzed by human genome microarrays. Differential gene expression was associated with histomorphological tumor regression. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was applied for verification of the predictive value of a panel of the identified marker genes, including 66 patients. RESULTS: We detected differentially expressed candidate genes with regard to response and nonresponse to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. The response-predictive impact of the novel markers, CUL2 and STK11, was confirmed by the verification study including 66 patients. Whereas CUL2 mRNA expression levels of greater than 1.7 was predictive for major response (p = 0.02) in adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma, STK11 was predominantly response predictive for adenocarcinomas. Downregulation of CUL2 (p = 0.04) and STK11 (p = 0.02) mRNA also correlated with a more favorable prognosis. CONCLUSION: We identified two novel markers, CUL2 and STK11, for response prediction in esophageal cancer. They will be applied to complement our panel of response-predictive markers to further individualize therapy.	Pharmacogenomics	\N

A score of 0 or 1+ was regarded as a low expression and 2+ as a high expression of the EGR1 protein.	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The transcription factor, early growth response 1 (EGR1) belongs to the early growth response family. EGR1 regulates the transactivation of genes involved in growth inhibition and apoptosis by ionizing radiation. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the expression of EGR1, and its relationship to prognosis, in patients with advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LHSCC) receiving chemoradiation therapy, and to observe the effect of EGR1 on the apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells treated with ionizing radiation. Expression of the EGR1 protein in tissue samples from patients with LHSCC was detected by immunohistochemistry. A high expression of the EGR1 protein was observed in 37 (67.3%) of the 55 LHSCC tissue samples examined. A high EGR1 protein expression in patients with LHSCC who were treated with chemoradiation was significantly associated with improved larynx-preservation survival (p=0.04). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate with larynx preservation was 59% in patients with a high EGR1 protein expression vs. 30% in those with a low EGR1 protein expression. In the human HNSCC cell line, PCI50, EGR1 mRNA expression was induced at 30-60 min, and EGR1 protein expression was induced at 60-120 min, after exposure to a 5 Gy dose of ionizing radiation. To evaluate the impact of EGR1 on radiation-induced apoptosis, we used small‑interfering RNA to knock down endogenous EGR1 gene expression. Cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 7, and cleaved PARP were decreased, while XIAP was increased, in EGR1-knockdown PCI50 cells compared to negative control PCI50 cells, at all observed post-irradiation time points. These findings suggested that EGR1 knockdown inhibits radiation-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, EGR1 may be associated with larynx-preservation survival, through the regulation of radiation-induced apoptosis in patients with LHSCC treated with chemoradiation. Although further investigations are required to support the present study, EGR1 serves as a favorable biomarker of radiosensitivity in the treatment of LHSCC.

104	XPF expression correlates with clinical outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	English	2011	21737503	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737503	Journal Article	\N	80	63	17	\N	56.7999999999999972	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	We included patients with untreated primary HNSCC of any site, treated with curative intent with radiation with or without platinum-based chemotherapy (either in a primary or postsurgery adjuvant setting).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Tumor-specific biomarkers that predict resistance to DNA damaging agents may improve therapeutic outcomes by guiding the selection of effective therapies and limiting morbidity related to ineffective approaches. XPF (ERCC4) is an essential component of several DNA repair pathways and XPF-deficient cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA damaging agents. The purpose of this study was to determine whether XPF expression levels predict clinical response to DNA damaging agents in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to measure XPF expression in tumors from a cohort of 80 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC treated with radiation therapy with or without platinum-based chemotherapy; samples were collected prospectively. Genomic DNA isolated from blood samples was analyzed for nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the XPF gene by using a custom array. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: XPF expression was higher in tumors from the oral cavity than from the other sites (P < 0.01). High XPF expression correlated with early time to progression both by univariate (HR = 1.87, P = 0.03) and multivariate analysis (HR = 1.83, P = 0.05). The one year PFS for high expressers was 47% (95% CI = 31-62) compared with 72% (95% CI = 55-83) for low expressers. In addition, we identified four XPF SNPs that showed marginal association with treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Expression level of XPF in HNSCC tumors correlates with clinical response to DNA damaging agents. XPF has potential to guide next generation personalized cancer therapy.

105	Expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) predicts response and survival of esophageal cancer patients treated by chemoradiotherapy	English	2004	15569370	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15569370	Journal Article	\N	76	65	11	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Positive reactivity for TP53, CDKN1A, CCND1 and CDC25B was deﬁned by staining in more than 10% of the cancer cells.	Patients received CRT (chemoradiotherapy) according to different chemotherapy regimens; however, the external beam irradiation was over 30 Gy in every case. Standard CRT, consisting of cisplatin (70 mg/㎡ , day 1) and 5-ﬂuorouracil (FU) (700 mg/㎡/day, days 1-4) and irradiation given as a continuous i.v. infusion, was given to 38 patients. A low-dose CRT regimen, consisting of cisplatin (3-5 mg/㎡/day), 5-FU (200-300 mg/㎡/day) and irradiation, was given to 14 patients. A different CRT regimen, consisting of nedaplatin, an analog of cisplatin (20 mg/㎡/day for 4 days) 18 and 5-FU (700 mg/㎡/day for 4 days) and irradiation, was given to 24 patients. Radiotherapy (40 Gy) was administered in 23 patients using anterior and posterior opposed equally weighted beams from a 10-MV linear accelerator in 20 fractions of 2 Gy. In the other 53 patients, an additional course of chemotherapy and irradiation of 20-30 Gy (a total of 60-70 Gy) were administered via two parallel oblique ﬁelds (deﬁnitive CRT).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Chemoradiotherapy is a multimodal therapy routinely used as a primary treatment for advanced esophageal cancer. However, it is beneficial only to patients who respond. To identify pretreatment markers predicting response and survival, we examined the expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules, p53, p21(Waf1/Cip1) cyclin D1, and CDC25B, in biopsy specimens from 76 patients with stage III and stage IV squamous cell carcinoma. Overexpression of p53, p21, cyclin D1 and CDC25B was observed in 58%, 30%, 28%, and 32% of patients, respectively. The expression of p21 correlated significantly with response to chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.0001). Survival of patients with p21-expressing tumors was better than that of patients with p21-negative tumors (P = 0.013). Expression of other genes was not significantly correlated with treatment response and survival. In patients with p53-negative tumors, survival of those patients with p21-positive tumors was significantly higher than that of those with p21-negative tumors (P = 0.0452), but no significant difference was found in patients with p53-positive tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that p21 expression was an independent variable among pretreatment parameters in predicting survival. These results suggest that p21 expression is potentially useful for predicting the response to chemoradiotherapy and survival of patients with advanced esophageal squamous cell cancer.

All of these patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a 5-week period with a 24-h continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed for those with either positive nodal status or tumor status of T3 to T4 in the Pre-Tx or Post-Tx status.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Genes associated with protein folding have been found to have certain prognostic significance in a subset of cancers. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of DNAJC12 expression in patients with rectal cancers receiving neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery. Through data mining from a public transcriptomic dataset of rectal cancer focusing on genes associated with protein folding, we found that DNAJC12, a member of the HSP40/DNAJ family, was the most significant such gene correlated with the CCRT response. We further evaluated the expression of DNAJC12 by immunohistochemistry in the pre-treatment tumor specimens from 172 patients with rectal cancers. From this set, we statistically analyzed the association of DNAJC12 expression with various clinicopathological factors, tumor regression grade, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). High expression of DNAJC12 was significantly associated with advanced pre- and post-treatment tumor status (P<0.001), advanced pre- and post-treatment nodal status (P<0.001), increased vascular invasion (P=0.015), increased perineural invasion (P=0.023) and lower tumor regression grade (P=0.009). More importantly, high expression of DNAJC12 was found to be correlated with poor prognosis for OS (P=0.0012), DFS (P<0.0001) and LRFS (P=0.0001). In multivariate analysis, DNAJC12 overexpression still emerged as an independent prognosticator for shorter OS (P=0.040), DFS (P<0.001) and LRFS (P=0.016). The data indicate that DNAJC12 overexpression acts as a negative predictive factor for the response to neoadjuvant CCRT and was significantly associated with shorter survival in patients with rectal cancers receiving neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery.

The chemoradiotherapy regime consisted of external-beam radiotherapy (4-6 weeks, 5 days/week; total 40-60 Gy), bolus infusion of cisplatin at a dose of 7 mg/㎡ , and continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil at 350 mg/㎡ (4-6 weeks, 5 days/week), concurrently. The radiation doses were different in the two regimens: 40 Gy was used preoperatively to improve local control as the preoperative therapy, while 60 Gy was used as the deﬁnitive therapy for patients who did not wish to receive subsequent surgical resection. The radiation ﬁeld included all areas of regional lymph nodes. Surgical therapy consisted of en bloc esophagectomy via right thoracotomy and reconstruction with a gastric tube. Three-field lymphadenectomy was performed in 28 patients (43.8%) with upper-third thoracic esophageal carcinoma or with lymph node metastasis in the upper mediastinal and/or cervical lymph nodes, while two-ﬁeld lymphadenectomy was conducted in 25 patients (39.0%) and transhiatal esophagectomy in 11 patients (17.2%).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The p53 gene promotes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis upon DNA damage and is associated with chemo- and radiosensitivity of cancer cells. However, its clinical significance has not been confirmed, especially in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC). We investigated the correlation between p53 disorders (gene mutation and protein accumulation) and the effects of chemoradiotherapy (CRT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Biopsy specimens obtained before CRT (40-60 Gy; low-dose 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin) from 64 patients with locally advanced (T2-T4) ESCC were examined for p53 gene mutations (MT) of exons 4-9 by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and protein accumulation by immunohistochemistry (IHC). These were correlated with the pathological effects of CRT and cause-specific survival. RESULTS: Pathological complete response (pCR) was observed in 21.9% (14/64) patients, who showed better survival than non-pCR patients (2-year survival 78.6% versus 40.5%, P = 0.007). p53 mutation (MT)+ and p53 IHC+ were observed in 31.3% (20/64) and 65.6% (42/64) patients, respectively, and each was significantly associated with non-pCR (P = 0.004 and 0.042, respectively). Combined evaluation of p53 MT and p53 IHC correlated well with pCR frequency, showing 0% (0/12) for MT+/IHC+, 0% (0/8) for MT+/IHC-, 20% (6/30) for MT-/IHC+ and 57.1% (8/14) for MT-/IHC-. These results indicate that presence of p53 mutations was associated with non-pCR regardless of IHC status, and that p53 immunoreactivity was helpful in predicting non-pCR among p53 mutation-negative patients. CONCLUSION: Analysis of ESCC biopsy specimens for p53 gene mutation can identify patients who will not achieve pCR by CRT. The results should be confirmed by large cohort prospective studies.

108	Expression of the prolyl isomerase Pin1 is a useful indicator of sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy in advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2009	19287979	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19287979	Journal Article	\N	68	59	9	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	PIN1 staining was classified as high (staining in 67-100%) or low (0-67%) based on the percentage of the tumor cells that were immunopositive and also the intensity of the staining, as described previously. CCND1 staining was classified as high when >10% of the tumor cells were positive and low when <10% of the tumor cells were positive. Evaluation of TP53 staining was classified as positive when >40% of tumor cells were stained and negative when <40% of tumor cells were stained.	Our radiation therapy treatment policy for esophageal carcinoma was to perform external beam irradiation of the primary tumor, the mediastinum and neck at a total dose of 40 Gy through anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior opposite fields. Then, an additional 20-30 Gy boost for a total dose of 60-70 Gy was delivered to tumors with oblique opposite shrunken fields to avoid irradiation of the spinal cord. Radiation therapy was performed with a linear accelerator using a 10-MV photon beam at a total dose of 40 Gy for preoperative cases and 60-70 Gy for inoperative cases. The dose was fractionated into 2 Gy daily, 5 fractions per week. One course of concurrent chemotherapy consisted of daily administration of 5-fluorouracil at 350-500 mg/㎡ as a continuous intravenous infusion over 24 h. The fluorouracil was administered 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Cisplatin or nedaplatin at 80 mg/㎡ was infused intravenously over a 2-h period, once, on day 1.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Cell cycle regulators, such as cyclinD1 and p53, play major roles in the tumor response to radiation and chemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Pin1-mediated prolyl-isomerization potentiates cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, including the regulation of cyclinD1 and p53. Herein, we investigated the effect of Pin1 in association with cyclinD1 and p53 on the sensitivity of esophageal SCC to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). The expression levels of Pin1, cyclinD1 and p53 were examined immunohistochemically in endoscopic biopsy specimens from 68 advanced esophageal SCC patients before CRT to determine whether their expression levels predicted the clinical effectiveness of CRT in individual cancers. Forty-six of the 68 patients (67.6%) had an effective response to CRT, whereas 22 patients (32.4%) had an ineffective response. There was no significant correlation between clinical responses and expression levels of cyclinD1 or p53. However, the clinical response of the high Pin1 expression group was significantly higher than that of the low expression group (P=0.0200). Moreover, our data indicate that the combined immunohistochemical evaluation of Pin1, cyclinD1 and p53 expression in pretreatment biopsy samples is a useful indicator of sensitivity to CRT in advanced esophageal SCC. Thus, Pin1 may influence cyclinD1 and p53 functions and predict CRT sensitivity.	Oncology Reports	Stage II: 11 patients, Stage III: 29 patients, Stage IV: 28 patients.

Between 1999 and 2000, the total dose was 40 Gy. The clinical target volume, which initially included all of the locoregional lymph-node stations in addition to the tumour, was modified and reduced to the directly juxtaregional nodes (tumour ± 4 cm craniocaudally), extended by 1.5 cm in all directions for the planning target volume, taking patient movements into account. The total dose was increased thereafter to 45 Gy using single doses of 1.8 Gy. From this time on, three-dimensional treatment planning with three- to five-field conformal techniques was used. Between 1999 and 2000, 5- fluorouracil at 300 mg/㎡/day was administered simultaneously with radiotherapy as a continuous infusion for 21 days by means of a systemic venous port system. Between 2000 and 2003, cisplatin (CDDP) was administered in addition to 5-fluorouracil five times weekly in weeks 1 and 5, at a dosage of 20 mg/㎡ . As of 2003, patients were enrolled in a phase I/II dose-finding study in which oxaliplatin 40-50 mg/㎡, administered once weekly, replaced CDDP. The dosage of 5-fluorouracil was reduced to 225 mg/㎡ per day, given as a continuous infusion. Surgery was performed on all patients within 1 week after the clinical response evaluation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Pretherapeutic identification of oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas that will respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is an important attempt for improvement of patient's prognosis. In the current study, pretherapeutic biopsies from 94 oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas (cT3, cN0/+, cM0) in patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (RCTx: 45 Gy plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) and subsequent oesophagectomy in the setting of a single-centre prospective treatment trial were investigated by means of immunohistochemistry. Expression of proteins involved in DNA repair and/or cell-cycle regulation, that is p53, p53 (phosphorylated at Ser15), EGFR, ATM protein kinase (phosphorylated at Ser1981) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) (phosphorylated at Thr68) was correlated with the response to RCTx and with overall survival. Tumours that were positive for CHK2 expression more frequently showed clinically determined regression after RCTx (69.4%) than tumours that were negative for CHK2 expression (32.1%; P=0.0011), whereas other parameters did not correlate with tumour regression. Expression of ATM correlated with expression of CHK2 (P=0.0061) and p53-phospho (P=0.0064). Expression of p53 correlated with expression of p53-phospho (P<0.0001). In contrast to clinical and histopathological response evaluation, none of the molecular parameters under investigation correlated with overall survival. In conclusion, expression analysis of p53, EGFR CHK2 and ATM has no predictive value in multimodally treated oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	British Journal of Cancer	\N

Concurrent radiotherapy was started on d 1 at 2 Gy/d for 5 d/wk. The total radiation dose was 60 Gy, with a 2-wk break after a dose of 30 Gy. The patients were followed up every 3 mo for the first 3 years after the end of treatment, and afterward every 6 mo thereafter. New chemotherapy agent (e.g., docetaxel) was applied for the patient with non-effective CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIM: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is generally sensitive to chemoradiotherapy (CRT), but some cases are not. Using a retrospective analysis, we aimed to identify the predictors of the response by esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to definitive CRT. METHODS: The intensities of expression of p53, Ki67, Bcl-2, Bax, cyclin D1, VEGF, CDC25B, and metallothionein (MT) were evaluated immunohistochemically in the biopsy specimens obtained before CRT, and the intensities of their expression were tested for correlations with the clinical effects of CRT. RESULTS: The esophageal squamous cell carcinomas with negative p53, positive CDC25B, and negative MT expression were found to be significantly more sensitive to CRT. In addition, p53 positivity and CDC25B positivity respond well to CRT. CONCLUSION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinomas with negative p53, positive CDC25B, and negative MT expressions respond well to CRT. Even with p53 positivity, if with CDC25B positivity, CRT can be expected.	World Journal of Gastroenterology	Stage I: 4 patients, Stage II: 7 patients, Stage III: 18 patients, Stage IVA: 7 patients.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The p53 family regulates cell-cycle arrest, triggers apoptosis or is involved in repair of DNA damage. In the present study, we analysed the expression of some p53 family proteins and their responses to chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in cases of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We immunohistochemically investigated the relationship between p53, p53R2, and p21 expression in biopsy specimens of untreated primary tumours and their clinical and histological responses to CRT in 62 patients with ESCC. Chemoradiation therapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin and 40 Gy of radiation. The rates of clinical and histological responses (complete or partial) to CRT were 71.0% (clinical) and 52.8% (histological). The rate of positive expression was 43.5% for p53, 37.1% for p53R2, and 54.8% for p21 expression. Statistically significant correlations were found between p53 or p53R2 expression and favourable response to CRT (P=0.0001 or 0.041 clinical, P=0.016 or 0.0018 histological, respectively). Furthermore, in p53-negative tumours, CRT was more effective in tumours with p53R2 negative expression than those with p53R2 positive expression (P=0.0014). We demonstrated that the negative expression of p53 and p53R2 expression was closely related to the effect of CRT and should predict the CRT outcome in patients with ESCC.

Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), a transcription factor induced by hypoxic condition, plays a major role in the pleiotropic response observed under hypoxic conditions. It encodes proteins that play key roles in critical development and physiologic processes, including angiogenesis, glucose transport and erythropoiesis. On the other hand, cell cycle- and apoptosis-control genes p53 and p21 may play major roles in the tumor response to cytotoxic agents such as radiation and chemotherapy. Previous reports have suggested that the regulation of p53 and p21 is HIF-1-dependent. Our aim was to evaluate the expression of the HIF-1alpha, p53 and p21 proteins by immunohistochemistry in biopsy specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which were obtained endoscopically from 65 patients before CRT, and then determine whether the levels of expression of these proteins predicted the clinical effectiveness of CRT in individual cancers. Also, to assess the relationship between expression of these proteins and cell death and cellular proliferation activity, we evaluated Ki67 expression and the apoptosis index (TUNEL). HIF-1alpha expression in esophageal cancer was significantly and negatively related to the response to CRT, independently of p53 and p21 expression. Interestingly, 44.4% (12/27) of the HIF-1alpha-negative group showed a complete response to therapy. There was no significant correlation between the expression of HIF-1alpha, p53 and p21 and proliferation and apoptosis. HIF-1alpha overexpression may predict resistance to CRT and may be a helpful guide in choosing between therapeutic strategies, such as intensive combined modality therapy vs. palliative therapy. Combined immunohistochemical evaluation of HIF-1alpha, p53 and p21 protein expression at the pretreatment biopsy is a very useful and powerful indicator of sensitivity to CRT in human esophageal cancer. Our data also indicate the importance of having a clear grasp of the degree of hypoxia (HIF-1alpha) of a tumor, rather than its cellular character (proliferation and apoptosis), to indicate the likely impact of CRT.

METHODS: p53 and p16 expression status, the Ki-67 LI, and int-2/cyclin D1 amplification were assessed by immunohistochemical staining and slot blot analysis in pretreatment endoscopic biopsy specimens of 41 patients with T4 or M1 Lym (distant lymph node metastasis) ESCC. All patients received a course of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) with radiotherapy. RESULTS: The CRT therapeutic response rate was 71%, and resection after CRT was successful in 15 of the cases in which the CRT effect was significant. The cumulative survival rate after CRT in the p53-negative patients was significantly higher than in the p53-positive patients (P =.037). The mean Ki-67 LI in the CRT response cases was significantly higher than in the CRT no-response cases (P =.023). Multivariate regression analysis revealed high Ki-67 LI to be an independent variable linked to a pathologic complete response to CRT (P =.033). The cumulative survival rate after CRT in the group that was p53-negative and int-2/cyclin D1 amplification-positive was significantly higher than in the other groups (P =.008). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating predictive factors in pretreatment endoscopic biopsy specimens may allow selection of more suitable multimodal treatment for ESCC patients and improve their quality of life.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate biologic factors on survival and clinical response after definitive concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: TP53 protein hyperexpression (immunochemistry [IHC]) and functional assay (FA) of TP53, measuring the ability of TP53 to transactivate p21 and bax reporter systems, were performed in patients with ESCC treated by CRT. The impact of parameters studied on survival and clinical response to CRT was assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients with ESCC were included. TP53 alterations were detected in 84.2% of cases with FA. All TP53 mutations abolished the transactivation of p21 and bax reporter systems. After CRT, complete response rate was 55.3%. The median survival of the population was 17.5 months. Serum albumin (p = 0.002), weight loss <10% (p = 0.005), and response to treatment (p < 0.001) were significantly linked with survival. TP53 alteration in FA was not significantly predictive of response to CRT (p = 0.132) nor survival (p = 0.154). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that wild-type TP53 in ESCC could be associated with good response to definitive CRT. However, the small rate of ESCC with wild-type TP53 suggests that systematic determination of TP53 status is not appropriate for the management of the ESCC population.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The ability to predict patients' responses to chemoradiotherapy by analyzing pre-treatment biopsy specimens would be valuable for managing oesophageal squamous-cell cancer. To this end, the expression of p53, thymidine phosphorylase and vascular endothelial cell growth factor was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 52 patients with oesophageal squamous-cell cancer prior to chemoradiotherapy. Treatment consisted of radiotherapy (40 Gy) and 5 day-infusion of 5-Fluorouracil (500 mg m(-2) per day) combined with cisplatin (10 mg m(-2) per day). Following treatment, imaging and endoscopic reassessment was performed to establish treatment response. Thirty-one patients underwent radical surgery and 21 patients were treated with an additional 20 Gy of radiotherapy. Of the tumours studied, 58% were p53-positive, 40% thymidine phosphorylase-positive and 44% vascular endothelial cell growth factor-positive. A clinical response was observed in 36 patients (69%) and was negatively associated with thymidine phosphorylase expression (P=0.02) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor expression (P<0.001). However, the 5-year survival rate was significantly lower only in patients with vascular endothelial cell growth factor-positive tumours (P=0.037). Multivariate analysis identified vascular endothelial cell growth factor as a significant independent prognostic factor (P=0.0147). These results suggest that expression of angiogenic factors has predictive value for the treatment response and outcome of patients with oesophageal cancer.

Therapy comprised four cycles per month, each cycle consisting of 250 mg per day of 5-FU and 10 mg per day of cisplatin administrated by con- tinuous intravenous drip together with 2 Gy irradi- ation daily for 5 days (Monday to Friday). Therapy was discontinued on Saturdays and Sundays.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with radiation (NAT) has been used in the active treatment of progressive esophageal cancer (T4). However, many patients are resistant to supplemental therapy, and it is necessary to to be aware that side-effects may occur. Accordingly, to minimize adverse reactions and cost, it is important to determine the indications for NAT. We investigated 34 patients with T4 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and examined the relation between the effects of NAT and immunohistochemical or additional clinicopathologic factors. There was no relation between clinicopathologic factors and immunohistochemical findings (p53 or hsp27 expression), and no clinicopathologic factors showed a relation to a supplemental therapeutic effect. In addition, there was no correlation between p53 staining and therapeutic effects (P=0.734). In contrast, there was a correlation (P=0.0058) between hsp27 staining and therapeutic effect. In conclusion, the usefulness of hsp27 immunostaining in predicting the therapeutic effect of NAT was confirmed in T4 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.	Diseases of the Esophagus	\N

This was combined with concurrent radiation 50.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fraction, 5 days a week for 5 weeks. All of the patients underwent esophagectomy through a right thoracotomy and abdominal incision (Ivor-Lewis).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: P53 protein overexpression in esophageal cancer and its correlation with response and survival after chemoradiation was retrospectively investigated. METHODS: Pretreatment and resection specimens were stained by automatic p53 immunohistochemical staining technique. RESULTS: P53 was expressed in 84.0% of esophagoscopy (EGD) biopsies; 71.4% of patients with metastasis of thoracoscopy/laparoscopy lymph nodes (TS/LS LN) identified by hematoxylin/eosin (H/E) were p53 (+); 14.2% of patients with negative TS/LS LN by H/E were p53 (+). Eleven out of 18 patients with p53 (+) in pretreatment EGD remained p53 (+) after chemoradiation; 38.8% of these patients had a pathological complete response (pCR). The median survival of this group was 15 months. Of 4 patients with p53 (-) pretreatment EGD, all of those were still p53 (-) after chemoradiation; 75% of these patients had pCR. The median survival was 30 months. In patients with p53 (+) TS/LS LN, 23% had a pCR after chemoradiation with a median survival of 16 months. In patients with p53 (-) TS/LS LN, 50.0% had a pCR with a median survival of 31.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: P53 protein overexpression in pretreatment EGD and TS/LS LN may predict response to chemoradiation and survival in esophageal cancer patients.	The Annals of Thoracic Surgery	\N

For BCL2, intracytoplasmic staining of more than 10% of the cells was recorded as positive.	All patients received preoperative chemotherapy (cis-platinum 20 mg/㎡/day and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/㎡/day by continuous intravenous infusion, D 1-5, 29-33) and radiotherapy with a cumulative dose of 36 Gy. After completing preoperative treatment, the patients underwent oesophagectomy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: To investigate the immunohistochemical expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus and to assess whether expression of these oncoproteins can be used to stratify patients into groups with a favourable or unfavourable response to preoperative chemo/radiotherapy. METHODS: The initial diagnostic biopsy and the corresponding resected samples were obtained from 22 consecutive patients with SCC. All patients underwent preoperative chemo/radiotherapy. Tumour sections were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against p53 (DO-7). Twenty four non-neoplastic oesophageal biopsy specimens immunostained for p53 served as controls. Twelve randomly chosen sections from the 22 SCC samples were immunostained to test for bcl-2 protein expression. RESULTS: After chemo/radiotherapy, 12 (55%) of the 22 patients had no evidence of tumour in the resected oesophagus. Before chemoradiotherapy, however, 17 (77%) patients were p53 positive. After treatment, residual carcinoma was detected in seven (41%) of the 17 p53 positive patients. All non-responsive cases had the same p53 immunopattern as before treatment. Bcl-2 immunoexpression was detected in six (50%) of 12 patients. Residual tumour was detected in the residual oesophagus in two (33%) of the six bcl-2 positive patients. After treatment, bcl-2 expression was no longer detected in the residual neoplastic cells of a previously bcl-2 positive tumour. Using Fisher's exact test no significant association was found between oncoprotein expression and response to preoperative treatment. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the observation that p53 protein is frequently expressed in SCCs of the oesophagus, probably as a result of a mutation of the TP53 gene. However, no significant association was found between oncoprotein expression and response to chemo/radiotherapy. Anticancer agents do not seem to modify the expression of p53 and bcl-2 proteins.

There schedules were repeated twice every 4 to 5 weeks and total radiation dose was 60 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to determine the clinical role of p53 mutations in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinomas treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The subjects of this study were 20 patients with previously untreated esophageal carcinomas with evidence of T4 disease and/or distant node metastases. Treatment comprised protracted 5-fluorouracil and 2-h cisplatinum infusions along with radiation treatment with a total radiation dose of 60 Gy. Tumor specimens from 18 of the 20 patients were analyzed immunohistochemically. Mutant p53 protein expression in the biopsy materials from the primary tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining using a polyclonal antibody, RSP53. Expression of p53 was detected immunohistochemically in 10 (56%) of the 18 esophageal tumors, the cancer cell nuclei of which were diffusely stained. There were no significant differences between the patient backgrounds of the p53-"positive" and "negative" groups. Four (40%) of the 10 patients with p53 expression achieved overall complete remissions (CRSs) and 7 (70%) of these 10 achieved CRs of their primary tumors. In contrast, none of the 8 p53-negative patients achieved overall CRs and two (25%) achieved CRs of their primary tumors. The CR rates overall and of primary tumors tended to be higher in the p53-positive than negative group, but the differences were not significant. The survival rate for the 10 patients with p53 expression was better than that for the 8 negative ones (P>0.01): their median survival times were 12 and 4.5 months, respectively. Expression of p53 protein may be an indicator of a favorable prognosis in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinomas treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

120	S0356: a phase II clinical and prospective molecular trial with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and external-beam radiation therapy before surgery for patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma	English	2011	22025151	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22025151	Journal Article	White; Other	93	87	6	62.2000000000000028	\N	[41.6,83.1)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	Treatment consisted of preoperative chemotherapy and radiation, surgery, and postoperative chemotherapy. Oxaliplatin 85 mg/㎡ as a 2-hour intravenous infusion was given on days 1, 15, and 29. On day 8, PI-FU was administered through a central venous catheter at 180 mg/㎡ over 24 hours continuously through day 43. Dose escalations were not permitted. External-beam radiationtherapy (EBRT) was initiatedon day 8,concurrent with start of PI-FU. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was not alllowed. EBRT with megavoltage linear accelerators (≥ 6 MV) delivered radiation to multiple ﬁelds. Patients were treated 5 days a week at 1.8 Gy/d for 25 fractions to a total dose of 45 Gy. At least two ﬁelds were treated daily; if a three-field technique was used, all three ﬁelds were treated daily. The target volume was deﬁned as the primary tumor and regional lymph node basin that would ordinarily be resected at surgery. If the primary tumor was in the distal third of the esophagus, the target volume was enlarged to include celiac lymph nodes.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with improved survival. The Southwest Oncology Group designed a trimodality, phase II, single-arm trial with objectives of achieving a pCR rate of 40% with prospective exploratory analyses of intratumoral molecular markers postulated to affect response and survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with clinically staged II or III esophageal adenocarcinoma received oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) on days 1, 15, and 29; protracted-infusion fluorouracil (PI-FU) 180 mg/m(2)/d on days 8 through 43; and external-beam radiation therapy (EBRT) 5 days a week at 1.8 Gy/d for 25 fractions; surgery was performed 28 to 42 days after neoadjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was planned after surgery. Tumors were analyzed for mRNA expression and polymorphisms in genes involved in drug metabolism and DNA repair. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were evaluable. Two deaths (2.2%) were attributable to preoperative therapy, and two deaths (2.2%) were attributable to surgery. Grade 3 and 4 toxicities were recorded for 47.3% and 19.4% of patients, respectively. Seventy-nine patients (84.9%) underwent surgery; 67.7% of patients had R0 resections. Twenty-six patients (28.0%) had confirmed pCR (95% CI, 19.1% to 38.2%). At a median follow-up of 39.2 months, estimates of median and 3-year overall survival (OS) were 28.3 months and 45.1%, respectively. Intratumoral ERCC-1 gene expression was inversely related to progression-free survival and OS. CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, PI-FU, and EBRT for esophageal adenocarcinoma is active and tolerable. Because the regimen failed to meet the primary end point, it does not define a new standard. However, future trials can be built on this platform to validate the role of ERCC-1 in determining the best systemic regimen for individual patients.

Failure of organ sparing therapy has been attributed to cisplatin and radiotherapy resistance in carcinoma of the larynx patients. In this study, we evaluate the relationships between p53 over expression/mutations, bcl(2) expression and ploidy status in a retrospective cohort of responder and non-responder carcinoma of the larynx patients. Tissue samples from 22 patients with histopathologically confirmed carcinoma of the larynx and matched for age, stage, node status and treatment regimen, were analysed from our tissue biorepository. Differences in the above molecular markers were analysed between the responders and non-responders to conventional treatment. p53 and bcl(2) over expression was checked by IHC and p53 mutation by PCR and direct sequencing. DNA ploidy and S-phase fractions were also analysed. Chi square analysis was used to identify changes in proportions of these markers in responders and non-responders and likelihood ratio test was done to determine the best predictor biological marker for treatment response. Bivariate relationships were determined between these variables using Spearman's rank correlation. Node negativity at time of diagnosis (p=0.05), p53 mutation (p=0.02) and bcl(2) negativity (p=0.05) are some of the factors that are known to influence treatment response in our study. p53 over expression, S-phase fractions and ploidy status did not seem to influence treatment response. There was a significant inverse correlation between stage of cancer (p=0.03) and node positivity (p=0.06) with bcl(2) positivity. There was an inverse correlation between mutation category to treatment response (p=0.01). The results suggest p53 mutations to be a promising marker in predicting treatment response in carcinoma of the larynx patients.	Oral Oncology	Stage III: 10 patients, Stage IV: 12 patients.

Scores 2+ and 3+ were regarded as positive for ERCC1 staining as previously reported.	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is now widely recognized as bladder-preserving therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). However, some patients who fail CRT may miss the chance to be cured by cystectomy. Therefore, it is important to select patients with MIBC who are expected to have a good response to CRT. Several reports indicate that the excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) gene is associated with resistance to cisplatin and radiation therapy. In this study, we examined the correlation between ERCC1 and CRT in vitro and in vivo in bladder cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bladder cancer cell lines T24, 5637, Cl8-2 (multidrug-resistant subline of T24), and CDDP10-3 (cisplatin-resistant subline of T24) were used for in vitro assays to measure ERCC1 expression level and growth inhibition with cisplatin or ionizing radiation (IR). We then examined by immunohistochemistry that whether ERCC1 nuclear staining correlates with the efficacy of CRT using cisplatin in 22 patients with MIBC. RESULTS: Cl8-2 cells expressed ERCC1 mRNA 5.96-fold higher than did T24. Cl8-2 and CDDP10-3 were more resistant to cisplatin or IR than was T24. Resistance to IR, but not to cisplatin, was removed by suppressing ERCC1 using siRNA in both Cl8-2 and CDDP10-3 cells. In immunohistochemistry with ERCC1, 6 of 8 positive cases did not have complete response to CRT, whereas 12 of 14 negative cases had complete response. Sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 85.7%, respectively (P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Although further study is needed, ERCC1 expression level may predict the efficacy of CRT for MIBC.

Radiation therapy was administered by linear accelerators with 10- to 15-MV photons. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22- 26) to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple-field technique. Surgical resection was performed 4-5 weeks after completion of chemo radiation after clinical restaging using the same procedures as for primary staging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the gene is spelled excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1) RNA-expression in peripheral blood as a non-invasive molecular predictor of response to neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced cancer of the esophagus. BACKGROUND: Only patients with locally advanced cancer of the esophagus with a major histopathological response to neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy benefit from this treatment. No non-invasive molecular marker exists that can reliably predict response to neoadjuvant therapy in this disease. To improve the treatment of patients with cancer of the esophagus, molecular predictors of response are desperately needed. METHODS: Blood samples were drawn from 29 patients with esophageal cancer prior to neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy. After extraction of cellular tumor-RNA from blood samples, quantitative expression analysis of ERCC1 was done by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Nineteen (65.5%) patients showed a minor and ten (34.5%) a major histopathological response to neoadjuvant therapy. ERCC1 expression in blood of patients was detectable in 82.8%. The median ERCC1 expression was 0.62 (minimum 0.00, maximum 2.48) in minor responders and 0.24 (minimum 0.00, maximum 0.45) in major responders (p = 0.004). No significant associations were detectable between ERCC1 levels and patients' clinical variables. Relative ERCC1 levels above 0.452 were not associated with major histopathological response (sensitivity, 68.4; specificity, 100%), and 13 of 19 patients with minor response could be unequivocally identified. CONCLUSION: Minor responders to the applied therapy show a significant higher ERCC1 expression level in their blood compared to major responders. ERCC1 appears to be a highly specific non-invasive predictor of response to neoadjuvant therapy in esophageal cancer.	Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery	\N

We defined a staining intensity score of 2 or 3 as high DPP4 expression.	Patients with rectal cancer were treated with a short course (a dose of 20 Gy in four fractions) or a long course (a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions) of radiotherapy using a 4-field box technique with concurrent chemotherapy to take advantage of 5-FU radiosensitization, as described previously. In total, 50 patients received short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 1 week. The remaining 35 patients received long- course radiotherapy with chemotherapy for 4 weeks. The time interval between preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery was 2-3 weeks for short-course and 4-6 weeks for long-course irradiation. The patients underwent standard surgery, including total mesorectal excision, and received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for a duration of 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: CD26 is a transmembrane glycoprotein whose role in various types of malignancies, along with the potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets, has been evaluated. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is an effective tool for local control of rectal cancer, but the rate of disease recurrence remains high. The aim of this study was to clarify the association between CD26 expression and rectal cancer after preoperative CRT. METHODS: A total of 85 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone preoperative CRT were enrolled in this study. We investigated CD26 expression in residual tumors and the surrounding stromal tissue using immunohistochemistry. Additionally, stromal CD26 gene expression was assessed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Patients with high CD26 expression in cancer tissue more frequently had serosal invasion, vascular invasion, and a poor pathological response. High expression of CD26 in the tumor stroma was significantly correlated with histology and tumor recurrence. High CD26 expression in the stroma, but not the tumor itself, was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis. Patients expressing CD26 in the tumor stroma, based on transcriptional analysis, also had a significantly poorer prognosis than those without the expression. In multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis and high stromal CD26 expression were identified as independent prognostic factors in patients with rectal cancer after neoadjuvant CRT. CONCLUSION: Stromal CD26 expression after preoperative CRT was significantly associated with tumor recurrence and prognosis in rectal cancer patients. Our data suggest that stromal CD26 plays an important role and is a potential therapeutic target in tumor relapse.

124	Value of ezrin, maspin and nm23-H1 protein expressions in predicting outcome of patients with head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma treated with radical radiotherapy	English	2007	16698950	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16698950	Journal Article	\N	120	96	24	60	\N	[35.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Normal squamous mucosa was negative for EZR and positive for SERPINB5 and NME1. Immunoreactivity was cytoplasmic for EZR and NME1, and nuclear and cytoplasmic for SERPINB5. For the three antibodies, the tumours were divided into two categories: group I (negative/weak) and group II (moderate/strong).	All patients received the same accelerated radiotherapy schedule using a concomitant boost technique. The planned total dose was 69.9 Gy, delivered in 41 fractions over a period of 38 days. The basic course was given to a total dose of 50.4 Gy over 5.5 weeks. The boost to sites of initial macroscopic tumour involvement consisted of a dose of 19.5 Gy and was given as a second daily fraction, starting the last day of the second week of the basic treatment. According to our institutional policy, 14 (12%) patients underwent a planned neck dissection before radiotherapy; either radical or modified radical, whereas in one patient, the involved lymph node was excised. 3	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors in predicting outcomes in patients with head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are limited to the clinical-pathological parameters, including lymph node metastasis, location, grade and stage of the disease. AIM: To determine whether the expression of these proteins has a value in predicting patient outcome. METHODS: Ezrin, maspin and nm23-H1 immunohistochemistry in tissue samples of 120 patients with HNSCC were evaluated using the microarray technique. RESULTS: In determining the association among each of the three proteins and the clinical-pathological parameters, low maspin expression was the only one found to be significantly associated with high tumour grade (p = 0.007); all others showed no significant associations. In univariate analysis, patients with tumours expressing high ezrin had a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) of 51% than those with low ezrin expression (DFS 84%; p = 0.08). In multivariate analysis, tumours with the combination of loss of maspin and low histological grade had longer DFS (83%) compared with those with high maspin and high histological grade (DFS 42%; p = 0.08). CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to determine the value of ezrin and maspin in HNSCC in a large series of patients with long follow-up. Ezrin and maspin seem to have a potential prognostic value in patients with HNSCC but results should be confirmed with further studies.

Four patients received additional doses of carboplatin, whereas for four patients, a dosage reduction of 50% to 75% had to be performed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Tumor immune microenvironment and tumor metabolism are major determinants of chemoradiotherapy response. The interdependency and prognostic significance of specific immune and metabolic phenotypes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) were assessed and changes in reactive oxygen species were evaluated as a mechanism of treatment response in tumor spheroid/immunocyte co-cultures. Pretreatment tumor biopsies were immunohistochemically characterized in 73 HNSCC patients treated by definitive chemoradiotherapy and correlated with survival. The prognostic significance of CD8A, GLUT1, and COX5B gene expression was analyzed within The Cancer Genome Atlas database. HNSCC spheroids were co-cultured in vitro with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose and radiation treatment followed by PBMC chemotaxis determination via fluorescence microscopy. In the chemoradiotherapy-treated HNSCC cohort, mitochondrial-rich (COX5B) metabolism correlated with increased and glucose-dependent (GLUT1) metabolism with decreased intratumoral CD8/CD4 ratios. High CD8/CD4, together with mitochondrial-rich or glucose-independent metabolism, was associated with improved short-term survival. The Cancer Genome Atlas analysis confirmed that patients with a favorable immune and metabolic gene signature (high CD8A, high COX5B, low GLUT1) had improved short- and long-term survival. In vitro, 2-deoxyglucose and radiation synergistically up-regulated reactive oxygen species-dependent PBMC chemotaxis to HNSCC spheroids. These results suggest that glucose-independent tumor metabolism is associated with CD8-dominant antitumor immune infiltrate, and together, these contribute to improved chemoradiotherapy response in HNSCC.

The expression of BAX and BCL2L1 was categorized as follows: negative if no staining was seen in tumor cells or if only a weak positive and heterogeneous staining was observed in less than 30% of tumor cells, and positive if staining was observed in more than 30% of tumor cells.	Of 70 patients, 57 were treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy followed by total or partial maxillectomy. The preoperative radiochemotherapy included local irradiation with a total dose of 50 Gy (2.5 Gy by; 20 fractions, 5 days a week) along with concomitant intramaxillary arterial infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil with a total dose of 5000 mg (250 mg by 20 times). The remaining 13 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone because of inoperable intracranial invasion, advanced age with poor performance status, refusal of surgery, or concomitant intercurrent illness.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Many researchers have attempted to correlate p53 mutation and spontaneous apoptosis with the effectiveness of radiochemotherapy and with prognosis in several malignancies. METHODS: The current study group consisted of 70 Japanese patients with maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Fifty seven patients were treated with radiochemotherapy followed by total or partial maxillectomy, and the remaining 13 patients were treated with radiotherapy alone. Tumor biopsy specimens at pretreatment status were examined for apoptosis-related proteins such as p53 protein, Fas, bax, bcl-x, and apoptosis using immunohistologic methods. The proportion of apoptotic cells labeled by single stranded DNA antibody was expressed as an apoptotic index (AI). p53 mutations at exons 5 through 8 were analyzed by direct sequence on polymerase chain reaction amplified products obtained from laser microdissected tissues. The effectiveness of radiochemotherapy was investigated histologically on surgically dissected specimens. RESULTS: p53 mutations were identified in 20 (29%) of 70 patients. p53 protein was overexpressed in 39 patients (56%), Fas in 20 patients (29%), bax in 40 patients (57%), and bcl-x in 33 patients (47%). Overexpression of bax was associated with negativity of bcl-x (P = 0.015) and with high AI (P = 0.024). Low AI and/or p53 mutation in the pretreatment tissues correlated with low histologic effectiveness of radiochemotherapy (P = 0.048, P = 0.019, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as univariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model showed that low histologic effectiveness of radiochemotherapy (P = 0.0281, P = 0.0284, respectively), p53 mutations (P = 0.0095, P = 0.0187, respectively), negativity of bax (P = 0.0069, P = 0.0191, respectively), and low AI (P = 0.0134, P = 0.0407, respectively) were significantly related to worse disease-free survival. Multivariate analysis showed AI as an independent factor predicting for disease-free survival (P = 0.0455). CONCLUSIONS: The p53 mutations, expression of bax, and levels of spontaneous apoptosis have prognostic value in maxillary sinus SCC; AI especially is an independent factor for disease-free survival. A high level of spontaneous apoptosis induced by overexpression of bax may increase sensitivity of radiochemotherapy resulting in good prognosis, while p53 mutation may lead to resistance against radiochemotherapy, resulting in poor prognosis.

128	Expression of cIAP1, a target for 11q22 amplification, correlates with resistance of cervical cancers to radiotherapy	English	2002	12208731	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12208731	Journal Article	\N	70	\N	70	66	\N	[37.0,91.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Nuclear BIRC2 distribution was scored as 0 for no staining, 1+ for <1% of cells staining positive for BIRC2, and 2+ for >1% of cells staining positive for BIRC2. Cytoplasmic BIRC2 distribution was scored as 0 for no staining, 1+ for a light and foamy staining pattern, and 2+ for a heavy and diffuse staining pattern.	Briefly, the external radiation was delivered with 10-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator at a total dose of 50 Gy to whole pelvis through anterior-posterior and posterior-anterior portals. A daily dose of 2 Gy was given 5 days weekly. Parametrial boosts using simple rectangular midline shielding blocks (4-cm wide at the midplane) were individualized according to stage to avoid over- dosage to the bladder and rectum. For stage I patients, a central shielding was used during the entire course of irradiation. A central shielding was set after 20 Gy for stage II patients and after 30 Gy for stage III and IV patients. For intracavitary irradiation, HDR brachytherapy using the remote after-loading system was performed. Patients were treated once weekly with a dose of 6 Gy to point A. Stage I patients typically received five sessions of HDR brachy- therapy to a total dose of 30 Gy. For stage II patients, a central shield was placed after 20 Gy so that from the third week onward, patients had four HDR brachytherapy sessions once weekly to a total brachytherapy dose of 24 Gy. For stage III and IV patients, a central shield was placed after 30 Gy, so that patients underwent three HDR brachytherapy sessions from the fourth week and the dose delivered was 18 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	Inhibition of, or increased resistance to, apoptosis is a common property of cancer cells. This means that a constitutive activation of antiapoptotic molecules via genetic or epigenetic mechanisms, including gene amplification, may well be involved in carcinogenesis. Recently we reported that cIAP1, an inhibitor of apoptosis, is overexpressed through 11q22 amplification in cell lines derived from esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and is associated with resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas to drug-induced apoptosis (I. Imoto et al. Cancer Res., 61: 6629-6634, 2001). Because amplification of 11q22 has been implicated in other malignancies also, including cervical squamous cell carcinomas (CSCCs), we attempted to correlate amplification and overexpression of cIAP1 with radiation sensitivity in CSCC-derived cell lines and primary CSCC tumors. In the nine cell lines we examined, two showed amplification and consistent overexpression of cIAP1, as well as significant resistance to radiation-induced cell death as compared with lines showing no cIAP1 amplification. Immunohistochemical analysis of 70 primary CSCCs from patients treated only with radiotherapy demonstrated that both overall survival and local recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer among patients with tumors showing high levels of nuclear cIAP1 staining than among patients whose tumors revealed little or no nuclear cIAP1. Multivariate analysis showed nuclear cIAP1 staining to be an independent predictive factor for local recurrence-free survival after radiotherapy among patients with CSCC. These findings demonstrate that cIAP1 may play an important role in the development/progression of this disease and that cIAP1 could be a novel predictive marker for resistance to radiotherapy in individual CSCC patients.

129	Bcl-2 expression predicts radiotherapy failure in laryngeal cancer	English	2005	15928664	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15928664	Journal Article	\N	124	106	18	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Sections with 5% or less of the tumour staining were considered negative.	Two groups of patients with laryngeal carcinoma, treated with curative intent by 55-60Gy of radiotherapy in 20-25 fractions, were retrospectively identified from databases held in ENT Departments in England.	Radiotherapy	5	Early stage laryngeal cancer can be effectively cured by radiotherapy or conservative laryngeal surgery. In the UK, radiotherapy is the preferred first line treatment. However, up to 25% of patients with T2 tumours will demonstrate locally persistent or recurrent disease at the original site, requiring salvage surgery to achieve a definitive cure. Patients experiencing treatment failure have a relatively poor prognosis. A retrospective analysis was conducted consisting of 124 patients with early stage (T1-T2, N0) laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In total, 62 patients who failed radiotherapy were matched for T stage, laryngeal subsite and smoking history to a group of 62 patients successfully cured by radiotherapy. Using immunohistochemistry the groups were compared for expression of apoptotic proteins: bcl-2, bcl-X(L), bax, bak and survivin. Radioresistant laryngeal cancer was associated with bcl-2 (P < 0.001) and bcl-X(L) (P = 0.005) expression and loss of bax expression (P = 0.012) in pretreatment biopsies. Bcl-2 has an accuracy of 71% in predicting radiotherapy outcome. The association between expression of bcl-2, bcl-X(L) and bax with radioresistant cancer suggests a potential mechanism by which cancer cells avoid the destructive effects of radiotherapy. Predicting radioresistance, using bcl-2, would allow the clinician to recommend conservative laryngeal surgery as an alternative first line treatment to radiotherapy.

130	Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and nm23 as prognostic factors in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	Chinese	2001	12761948	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12761948	Journal Article	\N	75	49	26	46	\N	[14.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Positive: positive cells >10%.	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nm23 expression for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma(NPC). METHODS: From Jan. 1991 to Dec. 1995, 75 NPC patients treated in Department of Radiotherapy & Chemotherapy, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, with follow-up of more than 4 yrs, were selected to enter this study. Specimens of 75 NPC were studied by immunohistochemical staining for VEGF and nm23. The immunohistochemical data were correlated with development of locoregional failure, distant metastasis and survival. RESULTS: Positive expression of VEGF and negative expression of nm23 were found in 54.7% and 56% of NPC specimens. Positive expression of VEGF and negative expression of nm23 correlated with the development of distant metastasis (P = 0.0181; P = 0.0091) and shorter survival (P = 0.0136; P = 0.0207). No association was observed with locoregional failure. No association was observed between the expression of VEGF and the expression of nm23.Cox proportional hazard model was used to compare the various factors and found the VEGF and nm23 expression were significant prognostic factors for patients with NPC. CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that the VEGF and nm23 expression are significant prognostic factors for patients with NPC and indicate that expression of VEGF and nm23 may be useful in identifying patients who may benefit from systemic chemotherapy or other novel treatment strategies.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To identify genes related to angiogenesis/metastasis that predict locoregional failure in patients with laryngopharyngeal cancer (LPC) undergoing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) treatment. METHODS: Tumor tissue was collected and snap-frozen from 35 sequential patients with histologically confirmed LPC being treated with CRT. Gene expression analysis was performed using a novel cDNA array consisting of 277 genes functionally associated with angiogenesis (n = 152) and/or metastasis (n = 125). Locoregional response was correlated to the gene expression profiles to identify genes associated with outcome. These genes were internally validated by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and validated externally by immunohistochemistry analysis on an independent set of patients. RESULTS: Locoregional failure occurred in nine of 35 patients. Seventeen genes from the cDNA microarray correlated with locoregional failure (two-sample t test, P < .05). Seven genes were chosen for additional analysis based on the availability of antibodies for immunohistochemistry. Of these seven genes, real-time RT-PCR validated four genes: MDM2, VCAM-1, erbB2, and H-ras (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = .008, .02, .04, and .04, respectively). External validation by immunohistochemistry confirmed MDM2 and erbB2 as being predictive of locoregional response. Controlling for stage of disease, positivity for MDM2 or erbB2 was an independent negative predictor of locoregional disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: Genomic screening by cDNA microarray and validation internally by real-time RT-PCR and externally by immunohistochemistry have identified two genes (MDM2 and erbB2) as predictors of locoregional failure in LPC patients treated with CRT. The role of these genes in treatment selection and the functional basis for their activity in CRT response merit additional consideration.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	\N
227	CA IX is an independent prognostic marker in premenopausal breast cancer patients with one to three positive lymph nodes and a putative marker of radiation resistance	English	2006	17085655	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17085655	Journal Article	\N	400	\N	400	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	PGR were scored as positive if the fraction of positive tumor cells was >10%, which is in line with current clinical recommendations. MKI67 staining was scored according to nuclear fraction using the following categories: 0% to 1%, 2% to 10%, 11% to 25%, 26% to 50%, and 51% to 100%.  ERBB2 staining was evaluated according to a standard protocol (HercepTest) and scored as four intensities [i.e., 0-3; these scorings were divided into two groups with normal/weak (0-2) HER2 expression and over-expression (3+)].	Postoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy) was administered after breast-conserving surgery and all lymph node-positive patients received locoregional radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Hypoxia in breast cancer is associated with poor prognosis and down-regulation of the estrogen receptor. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-inducible gene that has been associated with poor outcome in many epithelial cancers. Previous studies of CA IX in breast cancer have been carried out on mixed cohorts of premenopausal and postmenopausal patients with locally advanced disease and varying treatment regimens. We examined the potential prognostic and predictive role of CA IX in premenopausal breast cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using tissue microarrays, we analyzed CA IX expression in 400 stage II breast cancers from premenopausal women. The patients had previously participated in a randomized control trial comparing 2 years of tamoxifen to no systemic adjuvant treatment. Median follow-up was 13.9 years. RESULTS: CA IX expression correlated positively with tumor size, grade, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, Ki-67, cyclin E, and cyclin A2 expression. CA IX expression correlated negatively with cyclin D1, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor. CA IX expression was associated with a reduced relapse-free survival (P=0.032), overall survival (P=0.022), and breast cancer-specific survival (P=0.005). Multivariate analysis revealed that CA IX was an independent prognostic marker in untreated patients with one to three positive lymph nodes (hazard ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-9.13; P=0.027). CONCLUSION: CA IX is marker of poor prognosis in premenopausal breast cancer patients and it is an independent predictor of survival in patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. As all these patients received locoregional radiation therapy, CA IX may be associated with resistance to radiotherapy.	Clinical Cancer Research	N0: 109 patients, N+: 291 patients.
132	Prognostic significance of DSG3 in rectal adenocarcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy	English	2016	27040321	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27040321	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The median of H-score served as a cut-off value to separate these cases into two subgroups, low and high expression of DSG3, respectively.	The radiation dose was 45 Gy given in a daily fraction of 1.8 Gy. The protocol of concurrent chemotherapy was continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil for one day. After surgical resection, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was given to patients with nodal metastasis or T3-T4 stage, either in pre-CCRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy) or post-CCRT status.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of DSG3 and its association with response to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in rectal cancer. MATERIALS & METHODS: Data mining of a publicly available dataset was performed to find genes associated with CCRT response. Immunohistochemistry was applied to evaluate DSG3 expression. The relationships between DSG3 expression and various clinicopathological parameters and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The DSG3 gene was significantly associated with CCRT response. The expression of DSG3 negatively correlated with poorer tumor regression (p < 0.001) and had an independent negative impact on disease-specific survival (p = 0.011), local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.031) and metastasis-free survival (p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: DSG3 was a key prognostic factor and predictor for CCRT response in rectal cancer patients.	Future Oncology	T1-2: 81 patients, T3-4: 91 patients; N0: 125 patients, N1-2: 47 patients.
133	Gene expression levels of gamma-glutamyl hydrolase in tumor tissues may be a useful biomarker for the proper use of S-1 and tegafur-uracil/leucovorin in preoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with rectal cancer	English	2017	28417167	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28417167	Journal Article	\N	54	39	15	\N	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	Median	Preoperative radiotherapy was performed for all the patients using 18 MeV X-ray beams delivered by a linear accelerator (Clinac 2100 C; Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA) using the four-field technique. Irradiation was performed once (1.8 Gy) daily to a total dose of 45 Gy. Surgery was performed 7-9 weeks (median, 59 days) after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients in Group A received 5 weeks of radiotherapy with oral S-1 (80 mg/㎡) as concomitant chemotherapy. Oral S-1 was given for 2 consecutive weeks, followed by a 1-week rest, and was then given for 2 more weeks. Patients in Group B received the same chemoradiotherapy during the first 5 weeks as Group A and received an additional 4 weeks of oral S-1 chemotherapy until 11 weeks, according to the same dosage schedule. Patients in Group C received 5 weeks of radiotherapy with oral UFT (300 mg/㎡) and oral LV (75 mg/ body) as concomitant chemotherapy. Oral UFT and LV were given for 5 days, followed by a 2-day rest. This cycle was repeated for 5 weeks during radiotherapy. Patients in Group D received the same chemoradiotherapy during the first 5 weeks as Group C and received an additional 5 weeks of oral UFT/LV chemotherapy until 10 weeks. During the protocol treatments, clinical findings and laboratory data were evaluated every week during the first 5 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for rectal cancer. The effect of additional chemotherapy during the period between the completion of radiotherapy and surgery remains unclear. Predictive factors for CRT may differ between combination chemotherapy with S-1 and with tegafur-uracil/leucovorin (UFT/LV). METHODS: The subjects were 54 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who received preoperative CRT with S-1 or UFT/LV. The pathological tumor response was assessed according to the tumor regression grade (TRG). The expression levels of 18 CRT-related genes were determined using RT-PCR assay. RESULTS: A pathological response (TRG 1-2) was observed in 23 patients (42.6%). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis for pathological response, the overall expression levels of four genes, HIF1A, MTHFD1, GGH and TYMS, were significant, and the accuracy rate of the predictive model was 83.3%. The effects of the gene expression levels of GGH on the response differed significantly according to the treatment regimen. The total pathological response rate of both high-GGH patients in the S-1 group and low-GGH patients in the UFT/LV group was 58.3%. CONCLUSION: Additional treatment with 5-FU-based chemotherapy during the interval between radiotherapy and surgery is not beneficial in patients who have received 5-FU-based CRT. The expression levels of four genes, HIF1A, MTHFD1, GGH and TYMS, in tumor tissues can predict the response to preoperative CRT including either S-1 or UFT/LV. In particular, the gene expression level of GGH in tumor tissues may be a useful biomarker for the appropriate use of S-1 and UFT/LV in CRT.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The predictive value of microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumour cells and infiltrating immune cells for the efficacy of chemoradiation (CRTX) in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) was evaluated. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour material was collected from patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated within the ARO-0401 phase III trial with radiotherapy in combination with either 5-fluorouracil/cisplatin (CDDP-CRTX) or 5-fluorouracil/mitomycin C (MMC-CRTX). MiRNA and immune profiles were established in a test cohort of 48 oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPSCC) cases by Affymetrix miRNA microarrays and the nanoString PanCancer Immune Panel, respectively. Expression of miRNA candidates was measured in 149 HNSCC patients by real-time PCR. Interference of miRNA profiles with CRTX efficacy was determined by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Expression levels of five miRNAs (miR-27b, -130b, -200b, -451 and -532-5p) were significantly associated with overall survival after MMC-CRTX. Six different miRNAs (miR-125b, -146a, -150, -155, -187 and -342-5p) were correlated with overall survival after CDDP-CRTX. Validation by real-time PCR confirmed the predictive value of miR-200b and miR-155 in OPSCC, which was absent in hypopharyngeal carcinomas. MiR-146a was revealed as a prognostic marker for both CRTX regimens. MiR-200b expression was mainly associated with distant metastasis, whereas miR-155 correlated with local recurrence. MiR-155 and miR-146a were identified as surrogate markers for tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: MiR-200b and miR-155 were established as potential markers for personalised treatment selection of two standard regimens of CRTX. The predictive role of miR-155 deserves further investigation, especially within the framework of clinical trials of CRTX/immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations.	European Journal of Cancer	\N

Radiotherapy was delivered as external beam radiotherapy (n = 131) or a combination of external beam radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy (n = 12). Sixty-eight patients (48%) received combined chemoradiotherapy and 75 patients (52%) received radiotherapy alone. The prescribed radiotherapy dose was usually 60 Gy with chemotherapy and 64 Gy with radiotherapy alone. Fifty-three (37%)of 143 patients received neoadjuvant and concomitant chemotherapy, ﬁve (3%) neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 10 (7%) concomitant chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic drugs predominantly used were cisplatin and ﬂuorouracil; only a few patients received other drugs such as mitomycin. Three patients received radiotherapy with dose delays of up to 12 days because of treatment breaks related to adverse effects.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Carcinomas of the anal canal are strongly associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Expression of p16 is used as a surrogate marker of HPV infection. In a retrospective study, we evaluated HPV genotyping and p16 expression as prognostic markers of overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in patients diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages I to III carcinoma of the anal canal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HPV genotyping polymerase chain reaction (high-risk subtypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58) and immunohistochemical expression of p16 were analyzed by using paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies from 143 anal carcinomas. The patients were treated with combined chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. RESULTS: HPV16 was detected in 81.0% of the tumors, followed by HPV33 (5.1%), HPV18 (2.2%), and HPV58 (0.7%). p16 positivity was found in 92.9% of the tumors. In univariable survival analysis, HPV positivity was significantly correlated with improved OS (74% v 52%; P=.036) and DSS (84% v 52%; P=.002), and p16 positivity was significantly correlated with improved OS (76% v 30%; P<.001) and DSS (85% v 30%; P<.001). In multivariable COX analysis that included HPV status, p16 status, sex, T stage, N stage, and treatment, p16 positivity remained an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.61; P=.016) and DSS (HR, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.53; P=.011). CONCLUSION: p16 positivity is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DSS in patients with AJCC stages I to III carcinoma of the anal canal.

Furthermore, to analyze the predict value of radiotherapy effect. METHODS: The expressions of E-cadherin, CD44H, MMP-3, nm23H1 and VEGF in 62 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were determined by immunohistochemical SP method. There were 62 patients (17 to 70 years old) with nasopharyngeal carcinoma which were treated by radiotherapy from March 1995 to October 1995 and the period of follow-up had full 10 years. RESULTS: The expressions of CD44H (chi2 = 18.739, P = 0.028) and VEGF (chi2 = 18.523, P = 0.030) were closely related with short-term effect after radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The short-term effect was descent along with enhancement of their expressions. In the group of low expressions in CD44H and nm23H1, 3-year overall survival rate were 65.5% and 45.5%, and 5-year overall survival rate were 47.3% and 22.7%. In the group of high expressions in CD44H and nm23H1, 3-year overall survival rate were 54.6% and 75.9%, and 5-year overall survival rate were 27.8% and 53.2%. There were respectively significant difference between two group of expressions in CD44H (chi2 = 7.31, P = 0.0069) and nm23H1 (chi2 = 15.64, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicated that to detect the expressions of CD44H and VEGF gene may predict short-term effect of radiotherapy.

137	Expression of p27 in residual rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation predicts long-term outcome	English	2004	15525823	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15525823	Journal Article	\N	67	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The cutoff values for tumor cell staining were defined as follows: nuclear DCTN6 positivity if  10% of tumor nuclei stained or cytoplasmic DCTN6 positivity if  10% of cells had cytoplasmic staining; TP53 overexpression if 5% to 50% of tumor nuclei stained with strong intensity or if  50% stained with any intensity; CDKN1A positivity if  10% of nuclei stained with strong intensity or  30% of nuclei stained with any intensity; high MKI67 proliferative index if  10% of tumor nuclei stained with strong intensity or if  50% of tumor nuclei stained with any intensity; RB1 positivity if  10% of tumor nuclei stained; BCL2 overexpression if  30% of tumor cells showed cytoplasmic staining with any intensity; and CCND1 overexpression if  5% of tumor nuclei stained with strong intensity or if  10% of tumor nuclei stained with any intensity.	All 67 patients received preoperative external beam radiation to the pelvis consisting of at least 4500 cGy delivered over 25 to 26 fractions (180 cGy per day) with a 360-cGy boost to the primary tumor bed, for a total radiation dose of 5040 cGy in 28 fractions, according to previously described techniques. Forty patients also received preoperative 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, usually in combination with leucovorin, and 27 received both preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Agents and regimens were chosen on the basis of a sequential group of phase I and II trials of concurrent 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Patients underwent complete resection 4 to 7 weeks after completion of combined-modality therapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Compared with surgery alone, preoperative radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy (combined-modality therapy; CMT) improves outcomes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Although numerous studies have focused on identifying molecular markers of prognosis in the primary rectal cancer before CMT, our aim was to identify markers of prognosis in residual rectal cancer after preoperative CMT. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with locally advanced (T3-4 and/or N1) rectal cancer were treated with preoperative radiotherapy (median, 5040 cGy) with or without 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Residual tumor in the resected specimen, available for 52 patients, was analyzed for tumor-node-metastasis stage, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, and immunohistochemical expression of p27, p21, p53, Ki-67, retinoblastoma gene, cyclin D1, and bcl-2. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 69 months, the overall 5-year RFS was 74%. RFS was significantly worse for patients with positive p27 expression (P = .005), T3-4 tumors (P = .02), and positive lymph nodes (P = .04) in the irradiated specimen. On multivariate analysis, positive p27 expression remained an independent negative prognostic factor for RFS (P = .04). None of the other proteins was significantly associated with RFS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that positive p27 expression in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiation is an independent negative predictor of RFS. Expression of p27 in the residual rectal cancer may therefore identify patients with disease likely to be refractory to standard therapy and for whom investigational approaches should be strongly considered.

138	Tumor expression of major vault protein is an adverse prognostic factor for radiotherapyoutcome in oropharyngeal carcinoma	English	2007	17459603	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17459603	Journal Article	\N	78	57	21	59.7000000000000028	\N	[31.6,91.9)	Immunohistochemistry	The scoring system was as follows: 0 = no nuclear staining; 1 =< 10% nuclear staining; 2 = 10% to 29% nuclear staining; 3 = ≥30% nuclear staining.	The patients all received radical radiotherapy to their primary site and, depending on the nodal status of their necks, also under- went a neck dissection. Megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered by means of a 4-MV linear accelerator in daily fractions ﬁve times per week for 3 weeks. The prescribed radiation dose at the time for posterior tongue tumors was 50 Gy using lateral parallel pair radiation in 16 fractions. Tonsillar tumors received ipsilateral therapy of 52.50 Gy in 16 fractions. None of this cohort of patients received chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Vaults are multi-subunit structures that may be involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, with the major vault protein (MVP or lung resistance-related protein [LRP]) being the main component. The MVP gene is located on chromosome 16 close to the multidrug resistance-associated protein and protein kinase c-beta genes. The role of MVP in cancer drug resistance has been demonstrated in various cell lines as well as in ovarian carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia, but nothing is known about its possible role in radiation resistance. Our aim was to examine this in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Archived biopsy material was obtained for 78 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx who received primary radiotherapy with curative intent. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect MVP expression. Locoregional failure and cancer-specific survival were estimated using cumulative incidence and Cox multivariate analyses. RESULTS: In a univariate and multivariate analysis, MVP expression was strongly associated with both locoregional failure and cancer-specific survival. After adjustment for disease site, stage, grade, anemia, smoking, alcohol, gender, and age, the estimated hazard ratio for high MVP (2/3) compared with low (0/1) was 4.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.17-11.42; p = 0.0002) for locoregional failure and 4.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.85-9.95; p = 0.001) for cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: These data are the first to show that MVP may be a useful prognostic marker associated with radiotherapy resistance in a subgroup of patients with HNSCC.

139	Expression of the BRCA1 complex member BRE predicts disease free survival in breast cancer	English	2012	22706632	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22706632	Journal Article	\N	169	\N	169	\N	\N	[31.0,85.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	169 patients received radiotherapy following surgery.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in women. Recent advances in gene expression profiling have indicated that breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and the current prognostication using clinico-pathological features is not sufficient to fully predict therapy response and disease outcome. In this retrospective study, we show that expression levels of BRE, which encodes a member of the BRCA1 DNA damage repair complex, predicted disease-free survival (DFS) in non-familial breast cancer patients. The predictive value of BRE expression depended on whether patients received radiotherapy as a part of their primary treatment. In radiotherapy-treated patients, high BRE expression predicted a favorable DFS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.47, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.28-0.78, p = 0.004), while in non-treated patients, high BRE expression predicted an adverse prognosis (HR = 2.59, 95 % CI = 1.00-6.75, p = 0.05). Among radiotherapy-treated patients, the prognostic impact of BRE expression was confined to patients with smaller tumors (HR = 0.23, 95 % CI = 0.068-0.75, p = 0.015) and it remained an independent factor after correction for the other prognostic factors age, tumor size, lymph node involvement, and histological grade (HR = 0.50, CI = 0.27-0.90, p = 0.021). In addition, high BRE expression predicted a favorable relapse-free survival in a publicly available dataset of 2,324 breast cancer patients (HR = 0.59, CI = 0.51-0.68, p < 0.001). These data indicate that BRE is an interesting candidate for future functional studies aimed at developing targeted therapies.	Breast Cancer Research and Treatment	\N
140	ZNF750 Expression as a Novel Candidate Biomarker of Chemoradiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma	English	2017	28558382	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28558382	Journal Article	\N	87	77	10	\N	64.0999999999999943	[44.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The results of ZNF750 immunohistochemical staining were evaluated based on the percentage of cells that was stained in a ×100 magnification field, as follows: low expression, 0-29%; intermediate expression, 30-59%; and high expression, 60-100%.	All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (CDDP) followed by curative esophagectomy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: ZNF750, an epidermal differentiation regulator, has been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Although a correlation between the epidermal differentiation gene and resistance to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been posited, no data regarding the ZNF750 status in ESCC have been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between ZNF750 expression and response to CRT in ESCC. METHODS: Eighty-seven patients who had been pathologically diagnosed with ESCC were evaluated in the present study. All patients underwent neoadjuvant CRT, followed by curative esophagectomy. The expression of ZNF750 in pretreatment biopsy samples was immunohistochemically investigated and compared to the histopathological effectiveness of CRT in surgical specimens. RESULTS: High expression of ZNF750 was closely correlated with good sensitivity to CRT (p = 0.016). A univariate analysis showed that high/intermediate expression of ZNF750 was a significant predictive factor for good sensitivity to CRT (p = 0.006). High/intermediate expression of ZNF750 (30% or more) remained an independent predictive factor for sensitivity to CRT in a multivariate analysis (p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: ZNF750 expression predicts sensitivity to CRT and can be a biomarker that reliably predicts the response of ESCC to CRT.

168	Combined p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 overexpression predict improved survival in muscle-invasivebladder cancer treated by radical radiotherapy	English	2001	11728682	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11728682	Journal Article	\N	68	47	21	70	\N	[46.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated by radical external beam radiation at our institution (Northern Centre for Cancer Treatment). None of the patients in this study received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The interval between date of diagnosis of muscle-invasive disease and radiotherapy was 47 (30- 120) days. Patients were treated uniformly by 4-, 6-, or 9-MV linear accelerators, using a small ﬁeld beam directed technique with an anterior ﬁeld and two posterior oblique ﬁelds. The ﬁelds were normally 10 X 10 cm in size and covered the whole bladder (veriﬁed by a planning cystogram). Patients were treated prone, immediately after emptying the bladder. The London/Edinburgh regimen was used and a dose of >50.0 Gy delivered in 20 fractions over 28 days. All patients underwent a check cystoscopy and examination under anesthesia approximately 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The prognostic value of p21 and p53 expression was evaluated for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated by radical radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-eight paraffin-embedded sections from surgically resected tumors taken prior to irradiation were immunostained for p21 and p53. RESULTS: Nuclear staining for p21 and p53 was demonstrated in 32/68 (47%) and 46/68 (68%) tumors, respectively. There was no correlation between p21 and p53 immunopositivity in this group (r = 0.067, p = 0.56). Patients were stratified into four distinct groups depending on staining for p21 and p53: p21+p53+, p21+p53-, p21-p53+, and p21-p53-. Patients with p21+p53+ tumors had the best prognosis with a 3-year survival of 82% compared to 12% for p21-p53+ tumors (p = 0.0031), 29% for p21+p53- tumors (p = 0.0108); and 45% for p21-p53- tumors (p = 0.0375). The p21+p53+ group also demonstrated significantly improved survival when a combined analysis was performed of p21-p53+, p21-p53-, and p21+p53- tumors (3-year survival = 30%, p = 0.0062). In a multivariate model, p21+p53+ tumors (p = 0.0108, relative risk [RR] = 5.18) and complete/partial response (p = 0.0019, RR = 3.76) were the only independent predictors of improved survival. CONCLUSIONS: With muscle-invasive bladder tumors treated by radical radiotherapy, stratification for p21 and p53 identifies distinct prognostic groups, with p21+p53+ tumors being associated with the best survival and p21-p53+ the worst.

141	REG Ialpha is a reliable marker of chemoradiosensitivity in squamous cell esophageal cancerpatients	English	2008	18259819	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18259819	Journal Article	\N	42	\N	\N	64	\N	[48.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	We deﬁned a section as being REG1A-positive if it showed strong staining over >10% of its area.	Brieﬂy, chemotherapy consisted of protracted infusion of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/day) on days 1- 5 and 8-12, combined with cisplatin (40 mg/㎡/day) on days 1 and 8. This protocol was repeated twice with 5-week intervals in between. Concurrent radiotherapy was started on day 1 at 1.8-2 Gy/day for 5 days each week. The total radiation dose was 60-61.2 Gy; there was a 2-week interval after the dosage reached 30 Gy. Patients who showed an objective response to treatment were administered additional chemotherapy consisting of protracted infusion of 5- FU (800 mg/㎡/day) on days 1-5 and cisplatin (80 mg/㎡/day) on day 1. This protocol was repeated every 4 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: A reliable marker of chemoradiosensitivity that would enable appropriate and individualized treatment of thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancer has long been sought. We investigated whether regenerating gene (REG) Ialpha is such a marker. METHODS: We assessed expression of REG Ialpha in untreated endoscopic biopsy specimens and examined the correlation between REG Ialpha expression and the clinical responses to definitive chemoradiotherapy and prognosis. We also examined the relationship between REG Ialpha expression in the resected tumor and the prognosis of patients who received esophagectomy for thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancer. RESULTS: Among the 42 patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy, 8 of the 23 REG I-positive patients (35%) showed complete responses to chemoradiotherapy, while only one of the 19 REG I-negative patients did so. The survival rate among the REG I-positive patients was significantly better than among the REG I-negative patients. For the 76 patients treated surgically, there was no significant difference in the survival rates among the REG I-positive and REG I-negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: REG Ialpha expression in squamous cell esophageal carcinoma may be a reliable marker of chemoradiosensitivity. We anticipate that it will enable us to provide more appropriate and individualized treatment to patients of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

142	High expression of EZH2 is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy	English	2010	19904743	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19904743	Journal Article	\N	98	82	16	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	EZH2 immunoreactivity was classiﬁed into 2 groups: low expression, when positive cells were less than 50% and high expression, when at least 50% of the cells showed positive immunoreactivity in the nuclei.	All the 98 patients received the same concurrent chemoradiotherapy with PF (Cisplatin/5-ﬂuorouracil) regimen. Cisplatin was administered as i.v. drip at a dose of 80 mg/㎡ on day 1; 5-ﬂuorouracil 3 g/㎡ was administered as a continuous i.v. infusion for 48 hr on days 1-2. Two cycles of chemotherapy were done during radiotherapy at 4-week intervals. Radio- therapy was performed by an 8 MV linear accelerator. Two- dimensional or three-dimensional treatment plans using com- puted tomography (CT) scans were done. The initial treat- ment volume included the primary tumor with a radial mar- gin of 1.5-2 cm and a proximal and distal margin of 3-4 cm and enlarged lymph nodes. A total radiation dose of 60-70 Gy (1.8-2 Gy/fraction, 5 days a week) was delivered with 3-ﬁeld technique, and the treatment ﬁeld was reduced after 40-46 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a known repressor of gene transcription, has been reported to be associated with biological malignancy in several cancers. The potential oncogenic role of EZH2 and its clinical/prognostic significance, however, in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are unclear. In this study, the methods of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization were used to examine protein expression and amplification of EZH2 in 98 pretreatment biopsy specimens of ESCC who received definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). High expression of EZH2 and amplification of EZH2 was found in 54.1% and 12.0% of ESCCs, respectively. High EZH2 expression was significantly correlated with increased cell proliferation (p = 0.009), high histopathological grade (p = 0.002), regional (p = 0.025) and distant lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001) and lack of clinical complete response to CRT (p = 0.028). Univariate analysis revealed that high expression of EZH2 was associated with poor metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p = 0.003), poor progression-free survival (PFS) (p = 0.001) and poor disease-specific survival (DSS) (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, high expression of EZH2, together with lack of clinical complete response, were evaluated as significant independent prognostic factors of MFS, PFS and DSS for patients with ESCC. These findings suggest that high expression of EZH2 correlates with tumor aggressiveness and adverse patient outcome in ESCC treated with definitive CRT. Evaluation of EZH2 expressions might be useful for predicting tumor response to CRT and prognosis for patients with ESCC.

143	Prognostic value of kisspeptin expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24254791	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24254791	Journal Article	\N	140	96	44	48	\N	[22.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All of the patients received radical radiotherapy: A total of 26/140 (18.6%) were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and 114/140 (81.4%) were treated with two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-RT). Details of the radiotherapy techniques use are based on Lai’s report. The median radiation dose to the nasopharynx was 70 Gy (range: 66-86). Among the 140 patients, 25 patients with stage I to stage IIa NPC were treated with radiotherapy alone, and 115 patients with stage IIb to stage IVa-b NPC were treated with concurrent radiochemotherapy with or without neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy. The protocol used in the neoadjuvant, and adjuvant chemotherapy called for treatment with cisplatin and docetaxane or 5-fluorouracil every 3 weeks for three cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin administered on weeks 1, 4, and 7 of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The KiSS-1 gene has been reported to serve as a metastasis suppressor gene in various human malignancies. However, no information is available regarding the role of the KiSS-1 gene or its gene product kisspeptin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. METHODS: Kisspeptin and its receptor AXOR12 expression were assessed using immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 140 patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Immunoreactivity was quantified, and its relationships with patients' clinical parameters and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Using a 50% cutoff level, the immunoreactivities of kisspeptin and AXOR12 were divided into low and high expression. The expression levels of kisspeptin and AXOR12 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma were well correlated with each other (rs = 19.31, P < 0.01). Low expression of kisspeptin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was correlated with clinical stage (P = 0.01), N stage (P = 0.03), and metastasis (P = 0.02). Patients with low kisspeptin expression had poorer distant metastasis-free survival than those with high kisspeptin expression (75.32% vs. 83.79%, P = 0.02). Although neither kisspeptin nor AXOR12 were found to be prognostic factors for overall survival, kisspeptin was determined to be an independent prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival (P = 0.03) using multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In this study, we report for the first time that low kisspeptin expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma is correlated with poor clinical outcome; kisspeptin could serve as an independent prognostic marker for metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

144	Expression of p53R2, newly p53 target in oral normal epithelium, epithelial dysplasia and squamous cell carcinoma	English	2003	12565178	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12565178	Journal Article	\N	37	22	15	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Results were evaluated according to the positive tumor or epithelial cell percentage. Specimens with more than 10% positive tumor or epithelial cells were considered positive for TP53, MDM2 or CDKN1A.	Radiation was performed ﬁve times a week with 2 Gy at each session. The mean of total dose was 35.9 Gy (16-80 Gy). During the course of radiation therapy, the patients received cisplatin (80 mg/㎡ per body) or carboplatin (300-375 mg/body) and tegafur (300 mg/day) on days 21-28. Surgery was undertaken 3-4 weeks after the radiochemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Recently, the p53R2 gene has been isolated and shown to play a crucial role in DNA repair after DNA damage. The p53R2 gene encodes the p53 inducible ribonucleotide reductase small subunit 2 homologue, which is part of the p53 pathway. However, the function of p53R2 in human cancer is still unclear. We investigated p53R2 mRNA expression in human oral normal epithelium, epithelial dysplasias and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Surgical or biopsy-proven specimens of 10 normal epithelium, 48 epithelial dysplasias and 63 SCCs were collected in our department. Then, p53R2 was identified by in situ hybridization to visualize and localize the expression of specific mRNAs. The authors examined the p53 gene mutation by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. p53, mdm2, p21(WAF1/CIP1) and Ki-67 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry. p53R2 expression was detected in none of ten normal epithelium (0%), ten of 48 dysplasias (20.8%) and 33 of 63 SCCs (52.4%). In oral SCC, the expression of p53R2 was significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and histological differentiation (P=0.014, 0.046 and 0.022, respectively). p53R2 expression was significantly associated with p53 abnormality in epithelial dysplasia and SCC (P=0.034 and 0.009, respectively). Of 63 patients, 37 received preoperative radiochemotherapy. p53R2 mRNA expression was significantly associated with the pathologic response to radiochemotherapy (P=0.031). This study suggested that p53R2 expression could be associated with oral carcinogenesis. The presence of p53R2 mRNA expression would be a predictive factor for tumor development, tumor cell differentiation and the sensitivity to radiochemotherapy in oral SCC.

Concurrent radiotherapy was delivered twice daily, to a dose of 48 Gy, in 40 fractions of 1.2 Gy each, with a minimum of 6 h between treatments. From March 1995 to January 2003, patients were treated with 5-FU for 4 days, from day 2 to day 5, and omitted during the second cycle of chemotherapy. Concurrently, 38 fractions of 1.2 Gy each were delivered twice daily for a total dose of 45.6 Gy. Beginning in January 2003, 5-FU was replaced by capecitabine, and patients received induction cisplatin (60 mg/㎡ i.v.) on day 1 and capecitabine (2000 mg/㎡ /day p.o.) on days 1 to 14, followed by 1 week of rest. This was followed by cisplatin (30 mg/㎡ i.v.) on days 22, 29, 36, and 43, plus capecitabine (1600 mg/㎡ /day p.o.) 5 days per week, concur- rent with radiotherapy. The fractionation schedule was modiﬁed to 46 Gy in 23 fractions over 4 weeks (2 Gy per fraction per day). Surgical resection was performed 4–6 weeks after the end of radiotherapy, using a transhiatal, abdominal-right thoracic (Ivor Lewis) or right thoracic-abdominal-cervical (McKeown) approach.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	We assessed whether expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and/or thymidylate synthase (TS) can predict clinical outcome after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with localised oesophageal cancer. Paraffin-embedded pretreatment tumour specimens collected by endoscopic biopsy from patients treated with preoperative CRT (5-fluorouracil/cisplatin or capecitabine/cisplatin plus radiation) were analysed by immunohistochemical assay. Between March 1993 and June 2005, 129 patients were treated with preoperative CRT followed by surgery; of these, 108 biopsy specimens were available for analysis, and 40% and 35% were positive for ERCC1 and TS, respectively. Patients with ERCC1-negative (p<0.001) or TS-negative (p=0.04) tumours were significantly more likely to achieve pathologic major response. In multivariate analysis, ERCC1 was the only independent variable predicting pathologic response (p<0.001). Patients with ERCC1-negative tumours showed tendencies toward prolonged overall survival (p=0.10) and event free survival (p=0.08). Prospective studies are required to determine the benefit of preoperative CRT in ERCC1-negative tumours.

145	p53 and P-glycoprotein expression are significant prognostic markers in advanced head and neck cancer treated with chemo/radiotherapy	English	2000	10767716	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10767716	Journal Article	\N	111	78	33	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	The protocol required all patients to be treated with 60 Gy and four courses of chemotherapy and randomized to synchronous or sequential schedules.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The development of biological markers of response to chemo- and radiotherapy to judge benefit to risk ratios for toxic treatments is still at an experimental stage. Tumour cell death is largely by apoptosis and the p53 gene has a major influence on this. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) accumulation has been correlated with treatment failure in several types of cancer. p53 and P-gp expression were studied in 111 advanced head and neck cancers treated with radiotherapy and up to four courses of synchronous or sequential chemotherapy. The probability of survival at 5 years for patients in the trial as a whole was 27.7%, while the cohort used for this marker project was 29.4%. Among the subjects used for the marker study at the time of analysis, 13 remained disease-free and 18 were alive. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess p53 and P-gp expression; 27/111 (24%) head and neck cancers demonstrated p53/P-gp expression and 33/111 (30%) were both p53- and P-gp- negative. In univariate analysis, both p53 and P-gp expression were associated with reduced disease-free and overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed tumour size, p53, and P-gp expression as the most powerful pretreatment prognosticators in the study cohort.

146	Implications of p53 over-expression in the outcome with radiation in head and neck cancers	English	2007	17998714	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17998714	Journal Article	\N	55	48	7	\N	\N	[30.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	A 10% nuclear reactivity exhibiting chromogen positivity cutoff point was established.	Radiotherapy was delivered by a Telecobalt (Theratron 780C) using a 3 field technique i.e., lateral parallel opposed portal for primary and upper neck and direct anterior portal for lower neck and supraclavicular region. Electron boost was given to posterior neck in case of nodes astride the spinal cord. Radical dose of radiotherapy i.e., 70Gy in 35 fractions over seven weeks was delivered in all. Thirty four out of 55 patients received RT alone, while 21 received concomitant weekly single agent cisplatin chemotherapy (@ 35 mg/㎡) as a part of an ongoing protocol. Cisplatin chemotherapy was administered after adequate hydration and anti­emetic cover.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Abnormalities in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and in the expression of its protein are commonly seen in several tumors. The prognostic implication of these p53 abnormalities was studied in 55 patients with advanced head and neck cancers. PURPOSE: To identify p53 as a prognostic factor in assessment of response and survival outcome to radiotherapy in head and neck malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was carried out from April 1998 to December 1999. Fifty five patients with proven squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region were treated by radiotherapy (RT) (n=34) with or without chemotherapy (CT) (n=21). A dose of 70 Gy/35#/7 weeks was given with or without concurrent administration of weekly cisplatin (35 mg/m2). Paraffin sections obtained at the time of diagnosis, were examined immunohistochemically for p53 overexpression with monoclonal antibody DO-7 (DAKO). The scoring of p53 positive cells was carried out by a trained pathologist. Selected areas of p53 positive cells were viewed under high power field for quantitative assessment of the p53 over expression. A minimum of 1000 cells were counted and the labeling index (LI) was calculated in terms of percentage of p53 positive cells over the total number of cells counted. A 10% nuclear reactivity exhibiting chromogen positivity cutoff point was established. OBSERVATIONS: The data was analyzed as of January 2006. Median follow-up of all the patients was eight months (1-95 months). The median age of this study group was 58 years and of the 55 patients, 48 were males. Positive expression of p53 gene protein was documented by immunohistochemistry in 24 (44%) patients. Over expression of p53 was not associated with T or N stage, site of disease, radiation response or survival outcomes (P=0.143). Stage was the only independent prognostic variable, both for the response to treatment (radiation) and survival (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Over expression of p53 protein, when detected immunohistochemically, does not predict for radiation response in these tumors.	Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics	\N
147	Ku70 predicts response and primary tumor recurrence after therapy in locally advanced head and neck cancer	English	2008	18546291	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18546291	Journal Article	\N	73	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	In both studies, patients were treated with IC consisting of the administration of cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/㎡on day 1, and 5-FU at a dose of 1,000 mg/㎡/day by continuous intravenous infusion on days 2-6 every 3 weeks, per 3 courses. RT was administered to the primary tumor and clinically posi- tive nodes in 35 fractions of 2 Gy, each over a 7-week period at a total dose of 70 Gy. Nodal areas not clinically involved by tumor received a total dose of 50 Gy. CRT consisted of RT at the same doses plus 3 cycles of cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/㎡on day 1 every 3 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	5-Fluorouracil and cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy (IC) is commonly used to treat locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The role of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) genes (Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs) in double-strand break (DSB) repair, genomic instability and apoptosis suggest a possible impact on tumor response to radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin, as these agents are direct or indirect inductors of DSBs. We evaluated the relationship between Ku80, Ku70 or DNA PKcs mRNA expression in pretreatment tumor biopsies, and tumor response to IC or local recurrence, in 50 patients with HNSCC. Additionally, in an independent cohort of 75 patients with HNSCC, we evaluated the relationship between tumor Ku70 protein expression and the same clinical outcomes or patient survival. Tumors in the responder group had significantly higher mRNA levels for Ku70, Ku80 and DNA-PKcs than those in the nonresponder group. Ku70 mRNA was the marker most significantly associated with response to IC. Moreover, high tumor Ku70 mRNA expression was associated with significantly longer local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Ku70 protein expression was also significantly related to response, and patients with higher percentage of tumor cells expressing Ku70 had longer LRFS. In addition, the percentage of Ku70 positive cells, tumor localization and node involvement were significantly associated with overall survival of patient. Therefore, Ku70 expression is a candidate predictive marker that could distinguish patients who are likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy after the induction chemotherapy treatment, suggesting a contribution of the NHEJ system in HNSCC clinical outcome.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status was proposed as a prognostic biomarker for patients with glioblastoma. However, the prognostic impact of MGMT in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who receive carmustine-releasing wafers (Gliadel) along with temozolomide (TMZ) is still unknown. METHODS: MGMT promoter methylation status and protein expression were analyzed in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens obtained from 111 French patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients received the Gliadel wafers followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy while they were enrolled in a French multicenter prospective study. RESULTS: For the whole cohort, the median overall survival (OS) was 17.5 months, and the progression-free survival was 10.3 months. Patients with tumors that harbored MGMT methylation had a significantly longer OS compared with patients who had wild-type MGMT (21.7 months vs 15.1 months; P = .025). Similarly, patients who had low MGMT protein expression (≤15%) had a significantly improved OS compared with patients who had high MGMT expression (27.0 months vs 15.1 months; P = .021). The extent of resection was the strongest clinical predictor of outcome. In multivariate Cox models that were adjusted for sex, performance status, and extent of surgery, both MGMT methylation and protein expression were identified as independent prognosticators, and the finding was validated internally using a bootstrap resampling technique. Discrepancies were identified between protein expression and MGMT methylation status, thus suggesting that the 2 assays probably assess different biologic features. CONCLUSIONS: MGMT promoter methylation status and low MGMT expression both were identified as positive prognosticators in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent surgical resection and received Gliadel wafer implants followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and concomitant oral TMZ chemotherapy (the Stupp protocol).

149	Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A and HIF2A), angiogenesis, and chemoradiotherapy outcome of squamous cell head-and-neck cancer	English	2002	12128120	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12128120	Journal Article	\N	75	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Median	All patients had locally advanced inoperable cancer (Tx/N2b-3 or T3-4/Nx stage) and were treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions per week, total dose 68-72 Gy, LINAC 6-MV X-ray irradiation) concurrently with two different carboplatin schedules (Schedule 1 [51 patients]: carboplatin AUC5 on Days 1, 28, and 56 of radiotherapy; Schedule 2 [24 patients]: carboplatin AUC1 on Days 1-5, 8-12, 31-35, and 38-42 of radiotherapy). None of the patients underwent surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Hypoxia-inducible factors HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha (HIFalphas) regulate the expression of a variety of genes encoding proteins related to angiogenesis and to anaerobic metabolism of cells exposed to hypoxic stress. Their putative role as markers of clinically relevant hypoxia and, therefore, as predictors of response to chemoradiotherapy is herein examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using immunohistochemistry, we assessed the expression of HIFalphas in normal head-neck mucosa and in 75 cancer specimens from patients with locally advanced squamous cell head-and-neck cancer (SCHNC), treated with concurrent carboplatin chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Head-and-neck mucosa from normal individuals did not show any HIF1alpha or HIF2alpha reactivity. SCHNC showed a varying expression of HIFalphas ranging through negative reactivity, to weak or focally strong cytoplasmic reactivity, or to strong diffuse cytoplasmic/nuclear reactivity. Fifty-two percent and 33% of cancer samples showed the latter expression pattern for HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha, respectively, and were considered to bear "high" HIF reactivity. Bone/cartilage involvement was more frequent in tumors with high HIF1alpha expression (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha overexpression were significantly associated with high microvessel density (p = 0.002 and 0.02, respectively) and with VEGF expression (p = 0.01 and 0.005, respectively). HIF1alpha was related to high thymidine phosphorylase expression (p = 0.03), whereas VEGF/KDR-activated tumor vasculature was significantly more frequent in HIF2alpha-overexpressing tumors (p = 0.02). High HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were associated with incomplete response to chemoradiation (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02, respectively). In univariate analysis, high HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha expression were significantly associated with poor local relapse-free survival (p = 0.003 and 0.003, respectively) and with poor overall survival (p = 0.05 and 0.001, respectively). In multivariate models, HIF2alpha expression was an independent prognostic factor. In biopsies performed after the delivery of 20 Gy of radiotherapy, upregulation of HIFalphas was noted in some cases. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that the overexpression of HIFalphas in SCHNC is related to locally aggressive behavior, to intensification of angiogenesis, and to an important resistance to carboplatin chemoradiotherapy.

METHODS: 56 patients of adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland were divided into two groups according to the prognosis: poor prognosis group with recurrence or metastasis within 5 years (n=32) and better prognosis group (n=24) surviving tumor free within 5 years. The protein expression levels of p53, tumor suppressor gene, bax, apoptosis promoting gene, and bcl-2, anti-apoptosis gene, were analyzed by strepavidin peroxidase method. 8 cases of normal lacrimal gland tissues were used as controls. RESULTS: (1) The overall positive rate of p53 of the patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland was 73.2%, significantly higher than that of the normal controls (0, P < 0.05). The p53 positive rate of better prognosis group was 62.5%, significantly higher than that of the poor prognosis group (81.3%, P < 0.05). The protein expression of p53 in adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland was negatively correlated with clinical prognosis. (2) The overall expression rate of bcl-2 of the patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland was 69.6%, significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The expression bcl-2 protein was correlated with better clinical prognosis. (3) The bax positive rate of the patients with adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland group was 60.7%, not significantly lower than the control group. The bar positive rate of the better prognosis group was 91.7%, significantly higher than that of the poor prognosis group (65.6%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Some apoptosis regulating genes, such as mutation-type (mt) p53 play an important role in the gene ration and development of adenoid cystic carcinoma of larcrimal gland. p53, bax, and bcl-2 proteins may act as valuable signals for clinical prognosis. The patients with over expression of bcl-2 and bax and low expression of p53 may have better prognosis than the contrary ones.	National Medical Journal of China	\N

The regimen included two cycles of 5-FU given as 800 mg/㎡/d X 5 or 1,000 mg/㎡/d X 4 plus 75 mg/㎡ cisplatin with concurrent 45 Gy radiation followed by resection.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To assess the relationship between molecular markers associated with chemotherapy resistance and survival in esophageal cancer patients treated with trimodality therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The original pretreatment formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded endoscopic esophageal tumor biopsy material was obtained from 99 patients treated with concurrent cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil plus 45 Gy radiation followed by resection at Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC) from 1986 to 1997. cDNA was derived from the biopsy and analyzed to determine mRNA expression relative to an internal reference gene (beta-actin) using fluorescence-based, real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Possible markers of platinum chemotherapy association [glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTP1) and excision cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1)] and 5-fluorouracil association [thymidylate synthase 1 (TS1)] were measured. RESULTS: Cox proportional hazards model revealed a significant inverse, linear effect for TS1 with respect to survival (P = 0.007). An inverse relationship between TS1 expression and treatment response was also detected (P < or = 0.001). Univariate analysis identified an association with decreased survival for GSTP1 > or = 3.0 (P = 0.05). In multivariate analyses, TS1 >6.0, ERCC1 >3, and GSTP1 >3 were statistically significant predictors of decreased survival (P = 0.007). Additionally, the presence of ERCC1 >3.0 or TS1 >6.0 was associated with an approximately 2-fold increase in the risk of cancer recurrence (P = 0.086 and 0.003, respectively). CONCLUSION: The measurement of relative gene expression of molecular markers associated with chemoresistance in endoscopic esophageal tumor biopsies may be a useful tool in assessing outcome in patients with trimodality-treated esophageal cancer. These data should be validated further in larger prospective studies.	Clinical Cancer Research	Stage I: 4 patients, Stage IIA: 68 patients, Stage IIB: 6 patients, Stage III: 21 patients.

The positive control for RB1 was a positively staining section of hyperplastic prostate tissue.	\N	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: The retinoblastoma (RB) cell cycle regulatory pathway is known to be deregulated in virtually all known human tumors. The protein product of the RB gene, pRB, and its upstream regulator, p16, are among the most commonly affected members of this pathway. We investigated the prognostic significance of both pRB and p16 expression in locally advanced prostate cancers, from patients treated on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 86-10. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-seven cases from RTOG 86-10 had immunohistochemically stained slides, judged interpretable for both p16 and pRB, available for analysis. Median follow-up was 8.9 years (range, 6.0 to 11.8 years) for surviving patients. Staining for each marker was then correlated with overall survival, local progression, distant metastasis, and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Loss of p16 expression, as defined by expression was significantly associated with reduced overall survival (P =.039), disease-specific survival (P =.006), and higher risk of local progression (P =.0007) and distant metastasis (P =.026) in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, loss of p16 was significantly associated with reduced disease-specific survival (P =.0078) and increased risk of local failure (P =.0035) and distant metastasis (P =.026). A borderline association with reduced overall survival (P =.07) was also evident. Loss of pRB was associated with improved disease-specific survival on univariate (P =.028) and multivariate analysis (P =.043), but carried no other significant outcome associations. CONCLUSION: Loss of p16 is significantly associated with adverse clinical outcome in cases of locally advanced prostate cancer.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	T2: 13 patients, T3: 54 patients.
152	Expression and significance of p53-related proteins and LMP-1 in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma	Chinese	2009	19799083	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19799083	Journal Article	\N	62	47	15	41	\N	[13.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of murine double minute 2 (mdm2), p53, p21 and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) in nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) and analyze their relationship with the clinical stage and prognosis. METHODS: The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 62 patients with NKTL proven by pathology were collected. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were examined for mdm2, p53, p21 and LMP-1 proteins by tissue microarray technique and immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization was used to detect EBER1/2. RESULTS: The positive expression rates of mdm2, p53, p21 and LMP-1 proteins in NKTL were 61.3%, 79.0%, 58.1% and 48.4%, respectively, and EBER1/2 was 90.3%. The positive expression rates of mdm2 in Ann Arbor stage I, II, III and IV NKTL were 43.5%, 62.5%, 73.3% and 87.5%, respectively; p53 were 69.6%, 75.0%, 86.7% and 100.0%; p21 were 47.8%, 56.3%, 60.0% and 87.5%; while those of LMP-1 were 60.9%, 50.0%, 26.7% and 50.0%, respectively. With the progression of tumor, the positive expression rates of mdm2, p53 and p21 proteins gradually increased. There were statistically significant differences between them (P<0.05). There were statistically positive correlations among those three genes (P<0.05). The prognosis of the positive expression group of these three genes was worse than that of negative expression group (P<0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed between the expression of LMP-1 protein and the clinical stage or prognosis (P>0.05). The expression of p53 protein was an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: The expression of mdm2, p53 and p21 proteins is closely related with the pathogenesis and progression of NKTL. They are good markers for judgement of the biological behavior of NKTL. The expression of p53 protein is an independent prognostic factor. Though no significant relationship was found between the expression of LMP-1 protein and the clinical stage or prognosis, it may play some role in tumor progression.

153	Expression of ΔNp73 and TAp73α Independently Associated with Radiosensitivities and Prognoses in Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma	English	2006	16818688	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16818688	Journal Article	\N	84	\N	84	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Each case with positive staining in >50% of cancer cells or normal epithelial cells was considered as strongly positive for statistical analysis in this study.	84 patients were treated with radiotherapy, while some of them had additional treatment of chemotherapy and/or surgery.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The p73 gene produces different protein isoforms using alternative promoters and splicing, which have different biological characteristics. This study was to investigate the expression patterns of two distinct p73 isoforms (deltaNp73 and TAp73alpha) in cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and the relationship between their expressions and prognostic significance in cervical SCC patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the protein expressions of deltaNp73 and TAp73alpha in 117 cervical SCC and 113 normal cervical tissues using immunohistochemistry. The expression levels were analyzed with clinical variables and patients' survival. RESULTS: DeltaNp73and TAp73alpha were significantly overexpressed in cervical SCC compared with those in normal cervical epithelium (P < 0.001). However, their expressions were inversely correlated (P < 0.001, R = -0.368) and associated with differential tumor radiosensitivity. Overexpression of deltaNp73 was significantly found in SCC resistant to irradiation (P < 0.001), whereas increase of TAp73alpha expression was observed in the majority of SCC sensitive to irradiation (P < 0.001). Multivariate and survival analyses indicated that the expressions of deltaNp73 and TAp73alpha were independently associated with prognosis: deltaNp73 was associated with recurrence of the disease [P = 0.001; odds ratio (OR), 4.857] and an adverse outcome (P = 0.012; OR, 4.676), whereas TAp73alpha predicted a better survival of cervical SCC patients (P = 0.018; OR, 0.065). CONCLUSIONS: The p73 gene might be an important determinant of cellular response to irradiation. The expressions of the two main isoforms (deltaNp73 and TAp73alpha) might be potential markers for predicting the prognosis and sensitivity to radiotherapy in patients with cervical SCC.

Percentages of positive staining above the cutoff level were considered as high expression and those below as low expression.	All patients in this cohort primarily were treated with exclusively radiotherapy, using 6MV linear accelerator equipment. In patients with T1 to T2aN0 LSCC, clinical target volume consisted of the gross tumor volume with a 1-cm margin. Direct simulation was achieved using the inferior border of the hyoid bone and the cricoid cartilage as field borders. In this group of patients, two opposing lateral fields were used, with a median fraction dose of 2.0 Gy (5 fractions/week) up to 66 to 70 Gy in 7 weeks. In the remaining T2 LSCC patients or in case of lymph node metastasis, the initial clinical target volume consisted of the primary tumor, the pathological lymph nodes with a 1-cm margin, and bilateral elective nodal areas. For both the boost volume, consisting of the primary tumor and the pathological lymph nodes, as well as for the planning target volume, a margin of 0.5 cm was used. Two opposing lateral fields were used for the site of the primary tumor and the lymph nodes located in the upper neck levels. An anterior field for the lower neck levels only was added in the case of anatomical variations. A total dose of 46 Gy was delivered to the initial planning target volume; then, a boost dose of 24 Gy was delivered to the primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes (70 Gy in total).	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: The Fas-Associated Death Domain (FADD) gene is located in the chromosome 11q13-region and frequently is amplified in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Expression of FADD and its phosphorylated isoform (pFADD) have been associated with aggressive tumor growth, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival. Previously, we demonstrated that pFADD expression was related to a significantly improved local control in early stage (tumor [T]1 to T2) glottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). The aim of this study was to examine the prognostic value of pFADD and FADD in T1 to T2 supraglottic LSCC treated with primarily radiotherapy. METHODS: Tumor tissue sections of 60 patients with T1 to T2 supraglottic LSCC treated with primarily radiotherapy were assessed immunohistochemically for expression of pFADD and FADD. Expression percentages and clinical parameters and their associations with clinical outcome were studied using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Expression percentages in supraglottic and glottic LSCC were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Expression of pFADD and FADD in supraglottic and glottic LSCC did not significantly differ. In supraglottic LSCC, both pFADD and FADD did not show prognostic value for local control (hazard ratio [HR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-1.03; HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.60-1.78, respectively) and overall survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98-1.01; HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.83-1.71 respectively). In this cohort, lymph node status was the best predictor for local control (HR 3.73, 95% CI 1.30-10.67). CONCLUSION: In this homogeneous cohort of T1 to T2 supraglottic LSCC primarily treated with radiotherapy, lymph node status was associated with local recurrence, whereas the expression of pFADD was not.

Cetuximab was administered as single agent for three times at the doses of 400 mg/㎡ (loading dose), then 250 mg/㎡ weekly, followed by cetuximab 250 mg/㎡ weekly plus 5-FU (225 mg/㎡/day as i.v. continuous infusion 7 days a week for 5 weeks) concurrently to radiation therapy as neoadjuvant treatment. Radiotherapy was delivered with 15-18 MV photon beams, at 1.8-2 Gy/fraction up to 50-50, 4 Gy in 25-28 daily fractions for 5 days a week, depending on treatment policy of the center. Thirty-eight (95%) patients underwent radical surgery: median interval from the end of neo-adjuvant treatment to surgery was 49 days (range 26–72 days).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Cetuximab improves activity of chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Gene copy number (GCN) of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been suggested to be a predictive factor of response to cetuximab in patients (pts) with mCRC; on the contrary, K-ras mutation has been associated with cetuximab resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have conducted a phase II study with cetuximab administered weekly for 3 weeks as single agent and then with 5-fluorouracil and radiation therapy as neo-adjuvant treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). EGFR immunohistochemistry expression, EGFR GCN and K-ras mutation were evaluated on diagnostic tumor biopsy. Dworak's tumor regression grade (TRG) was evaluated on surgical specimens. RESULTS: Forty pts have been treated; 39 pts are assessable. TRG 3 and 4 were achieved in nine (23.1%) and three pts (7.7%) respectively; TRG 3-4 rate was 55% and 5.3% in case of high and low GCN, respectively (P 0.0016). Pts with K-ras mutated tumors had lower rate of high TRG: 11% versus 36.7% (P 0.12). In pts with wild-type K-ras, TRG 3-4 rate was 58.8% versus 7.7% in case of high or low GCN, respectively (P 0.0012). CONCLUSIONS: In pts with LARC, EGFR GCN is predictive of high TRG to cetuximab plus 5-FU radiotherapy. Moreover, our data suggest that a wild-type K-ras associated with a high EGFR GCN can predict sensitivity to cetuximab-based treatment.

155	Downregulated ECRG4 is correlated with lymph node metastasis and predicts poor outcome for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	English	2017	27119734	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27119734	Journal Article	\N	122	89	33	47	48.1199999999999974	[18.0,73.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Staining (25%) was used as cutoff point to deﬁne high ECRG4 expression and low ECRG4 expression.	All patients received standard curative radiotherapy (3D conformal radiotherapy, 3D-CRT), with or without chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: Esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (ECRG4) is a new candidate tumor suppressor gene. In this retrospective study, we evaluated ECRG4 protein expression in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) under curative treatment and examined its association with pathological features and clinical outcomes as a possible biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of NPC. METHODS: We enrolled 122 patients with a first diagnosis between January 2001 and December 2003. Tumor tissue and control tissue from biopsies underwent immunohistochemical staining for ECRG4. ECRG4 expression was analyzed by clinicopathological variables. After Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the predictive effect of ECRG4 expression on overall survival. RESULTS: ECRG4 protein level was lower in NPC than control tissue (P < 0.01). It was inversely related to node status (P < 0.001) and clinical stage (P = 0.027). ECRG4 expression was associated with overall survival, and downregulated ECRG4 expression was an independent prognostic factor of poor survival (hazard ratio = 0.677, 95 % confidence interval 0.463-0.989, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: A significant NPC patients showed downregulated ECRG4 expression, which is correlated with lymph node metastasis. The marker could be an independent prognostic factor for NPC patients. The precise function of ECRG4 in the progression of NPC, especially for lymphatic metastasis, deserves further investigation, which would bring a new target for personalized therapy.

156	Hypoxia-inducible proteins HIF1α and lactate dehydrogenase LDH5, key markers of anaerobic metabolism, relate with stem cell markers and poor post-radiotherapy outcome in bladder cancer	English	2016	27010533	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27010533	Journal Article	\N	82	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Briefly, tumors with strong cytoplasmic expression in >50% of cancer cells and/or tumors with nuclear expression in >10% of cancer cells were considered to have high HIF1A or LDH5 reactivity. For MIB1 and CD44,  values higher than the median value were used to group cases as of high proliferation index or protein expression.	A hypofractionated and accelerated concomitant boost scheme supported with amifostine cytoprotection was applied, delivering 15 consecutive fractions of 3.4 Gy to the bladder and 14 fractions of 2.7 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes. The overall treatment time was 3 weeks. Half of these patients had received Liposomal Doxorubicin (Caelyx) 20 mg/㎡ administered every 2 weeks for a total of three cycles concurrently with radiation. 	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To assess whether anaerobic metabolism, proliferation activity and stem cell content are linked with radioresistance in bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue sections from 66 patients with invasive transitional cell bladder cancer treated with hypofractionated accelerated radiotherapy, was immunohistochemically analyzed for the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α (HIF1α) and the anaerobic glycolysis enzyme lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5). Proliferation index (Ki-67) and stem-cell marker (cluster of differentiation CD44, aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH1) expression was also examined. RESULTS: Both HIF1α and LDH5 expression were linked with high CD44 stem cell population (p = 0.001 and 0.05, respectively), while high Ki-67 proliferation index was linked with nuclear LDH5 expression (p = 0.03) and high histological grade (p = 0.02). A strong significant association of HIF1α (p = 0.0009) and of LDH5 (p < 0.0001) with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) was noted, which was also confirmed in multivariate analysis. A significant association with overall survival was also noted. Silencing of lactate dehydrogenase LDHA gene in the human RT112 bladder cancer cell line, or exposure to oxamate (LDH activity inhibitor), resulted in strong radio-sensitization. CONCLUSIONS: HIF1α and LDH5 are markers of poor outcome in patients with bladder cancer treated with radiotherapy. Blockage of anaerobic metabolism may prove of importance in clinical radiotherapy.

157	Correlation of pretreatment 18F-FDG PET tumor textural features with gene expression in pharyngeal cancer and implications for radiotherapy-based treatment outcomes	English	2017	27999896	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999896	Journal Article	\N	57	\N	\N	53	\N	[32.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients received radiation doses of 1.8 Gy daily up to a total dose of 68.4-73.8 Gy (median, 70.2 Gy). All patients received radiation doses of 1.8 Gy daily up to a total dose of 68.4–73.8 Gy (median, 70.2 Gy). Two clinical target volumes (CTVs) were administered for various risks: CTV1, encompassing the GTV of a primary tumor (GTVp), metastatic lymph nodes, and regions adjacent to the GTV; and CTV2, encompassing the ipsilateral or contralateral N0 regions at risk of microscopic tumor. A dose of 50.4-54.0 Gy was included by 16.2-21.6 Gy in CTV1 during the second course. Thus, a median cumulative dose of 70.2 and 54.0 Gt was administered in CTV1 and CTV2, respectively. The median radiotherapy duration was 56 days. Fifty patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin (80-100 mg/㎡ on dys 1, 22 and 43); five patients received combined cetuximab and RT (loading dose, 400 mg/㎡; 250 mg/㎡ thereafter); and two patients received RT alone.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: This study investigated the correlation of the matrix heterogeneity of tumors on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with gene-expression profiling in patients with pharyngeal cancer and determined the prognostic factors for radiotherapy-based treatment outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 57 patients with stage III-IV oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer who had completed definitive therapy. Four groups of the textural features as well as 31 indices were studied in addition to maximum standard uptake value, metastatic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis. Immunohistochemical data from pretreatment biopsy specimens (Glut1, CAIX, VEGF, HIF-1α, EGFR, Ki-67, Bcl-2, CLAUDIN-4, YAP-1, c-Met, and p16) were analyzed. The relationships between the indices and genomic expression were studied, and the robustness of various textural features relative to cause-specific survival and primary relapse-free survival was analyzed. RESULTS: The overexpression of VEGF was positively associated with the increased values of the matrix heterogeneity obtained using gray-level nonuniformity for zone (GLNUz) and run-length nonuniformity (RLNU). Advanced T stage (p = 0.01, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.38), a VEGF immunoreactive score of >2 (p = 0.03, HR = 2.79), and a higher GLNUz value (p = 0.04, HR = 2.51) were prognostic factors for low cause-specific survival, whereas advanced T stage, a HIF-1α staining percentage of ≥80%, and a higher GLNUz value were prognostic factors for low primary-relapse free survival. CONCLUSIONS: The overexpression of VEGF was associated with the increased matrix index of GLNUz and RLNU. For patients with pharyngeal cancer requiring radiotherapy, the treatment outcome can be stratified according to the textural features, T stage, and biomarkers.

158	Overexpression of HIF1α and CAXI predicts poor outcome in early-stage triple negative breast cancer	English	2016	27184798	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184798	Journal Article	\N	270	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For HIF1A expression, strong nuclear staining of ≥1 % tumor cells was considered positive. For CA9 staining of ≥10 %, tumor cells were interpreted as positive.	Patients received 4 to 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide-based combined adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered after completion of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Dysregulated energy metabolism is one of the main mechanisms for uncontrolled growth in solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) is a transcription factor implicated in regulating several genes that are responsible for cell metabolism, including carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). The aim of this study is to determine the clinical significance of immunohistochemical metabolic alteration in early-stage triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients who received cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy and those with basal phenotype. Immunohistochemical staining for HIF1α and CAIX was performed to determine the correlation with clinicopathologic variables and survival outcome on tissue microarrays from 270 early-stage TNBC patients. In vitro experiments with multiple human TNBC cell lines, suppression of HIF1α by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced CAIX protein expression in all cell lines. In multivariate analyses for different therapeutic modalities and basal phenotype, combined HIF1α and CAIX protein overexpression was significantly associated with disease-free survival in the total cohort (OR = 2.583, P = 0.002), stratified cohorts expressing basal phenotype (OR = 2.234, P = 0.021), and in those patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (OR = 3.078, P = 0.023) and adjuvant radiotherapy (OR = 2.111, P = 0.050), respectively. In early TNBC, combined HIF1α and CAIX protein expression may serve as an unfavorable prognostic indicator particularly in patients treated with cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy or radiotherapy as well as those with basal phenotype of breast cancer.

159	Prognostic significance of urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 mRNA expression in lymph node- and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer	English	2006	16945123	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16945123	Journal Article	\N	87	\N	\N	54	53	[29.0,74.0)	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	All patients received radiotherapy, adjuvant polychemotherapy and five years of Tamoxifen treatment. The standard chemotherapy regimen consisted of either four cycles of doxorubicin or epirubicin given in combination with cyclophosphamide [4 x AC/EC], or six cycles of 5-flourouracil, doxorubicin/epirubicin and cyclophosphamide [6 x FAC/FEC].	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: One of the most thoroughly studied systems in relation to its prognostic relevance in patients with breast cancer, is the plasminogen activation system that comprises of, among others, the urokinase Plasminogen Activator (uPA) and its main inhibitor, the Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In this study, we investigated the prognostic value of uPA and PAI-1 at the mRNA level in lymph node- and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. METHODS: The study included a retrospective series of 87 patients with hormone-receptor positive and axillary lymph node-positive breast cancer. All patients received radiotherapy, adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy and five years of tamoxifen treatment. The median patient age was 54 and the median follow-up time was 79 months. Distant relapse occurred in 30 patients and 22 patients died from breast cancer during follow-up. We investigated the prognostic value of uPA and PAI-1 at the mRNA level as measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: uPA and PAI-1 gene expression was not found to be correlated with any of the established clinical and pathological factors. Metastasis-free Survival (MFS) and Breast Cancer specific Survival (BCS) were significantly shorter in patients expressing high levels of PAI-1 mRNA (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; respectively). In Cox multivariate analysis, the level of PAI-1 mRNA appeared to be the strongest prognostic factor for MFS (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 10.12; p = 0.0002) and for BCS (HR = 13.17; p = 0.0003). Furthermore, uPA gene expression was not significantly associated neither with MFS (p = 0.41) nor with BCS (p = 0.19). In a Cox-multivariate regression analysis, uPA expression did not demonstrate significant independent prognostic value. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that high PAI-1 mRNA expression represents a strong and independent unfavorable prognostic factor for the development of metastases and for breast cancer specific survival in a population of hormone receptor- and lymph node-positive breast cancer patients.

196	Low BAX protein expression correlates with disease recurrence in preoperatively irradiated rectalcarcinoma	English	2005	15629598	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15629598	Journal Article	\N	92	41	51	\N	62.7000000000000028	[38.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The BAX staining index (BSI) was categorized according to the product of the staining intensity (1, not detectable; 2, weak; 3, moderate; and 4, strong) and the percentage of positive stained cells (1, 0%; 2, 1-60%; 3, 61-80%; 4, 81-99%; and 5, 100%). Thus, the range of BSI was 1-20, and samples were dichotomized as follows: low BAX expression, BSI 1-6, and high BAX expression, BSI  6-20.	The patients received preoperatively a total radiation dose of 30 Gy (2 Gy fractions) over 15 days. After a median interval of 14 days (range, 3–85 days), 69 and 23 of the patients underwent anterior and abdominoperineal resection of the rectum, respectively.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic impact of BAX in correlation to its upstream effector p53 as well as clinicopathologic variables and patient outcome in preoperatively irradiated rectal carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We investigated 92 rectal carcinoma patients treated by preoperative radiotherapy to a total dose of 30 Gy followed by surgery. Median follow-up was 71 months. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections of pretreatment biopsy samples for BAX protein. Also, we considered the previously determined p53 expression data from this cohort. RESULTS: BAX protein expression was classified as high and low in 63 (68.5%) and 29 (31.5%) tumors, respectively. Unlike clinicopathologic variables, high BAX expression was significantly associated with improved disease-free survival by univariate analysis (p = 0.048). Moreover, in multivariate analyses, high BAX expression was an independent prognostic indicator for both improved local recurrence-free interval and improved disease-free survival (p = 0.03 and 0.047, respectively). Concerning the p53/BAX pathway, subgroup analysis yielded no association between p53 immunonegative/BAX high vs. p53 immunopositive/BAX low expressing tumors with regard to overall, disease-free, or local recurrence-free survival in either univariate (p = 0.88, 0.54, and 0.16, respectively) or multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that BAX protein expression might help to predict disease recurrence in preoperatively irradiated rectal carcinoma, whereas determination of p53, the proposed upstream regulator of BAX-induced apoptosis, did not provide additional prognostic information.

160	Functional microarray analysis suggests repressed cell-cell signaling and cell survival-related modules inhibit progression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2011	21489260	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21489260	Journal Article	\N	128	104	24	\N	\N	[23.0,88.0)	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	During surgery, all patients were submitted to neck dissection. No patients received chemotherapy before or after surgery. All patients whose samples were used in the comparison between recurrent versus non-recurrent tumors were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Cancer shows a great diversity in its clinical behavior which cannot be easily predicted using the currently available clinical or pathological markers. The identification of pathways associated with lymph node metastasis (N+) and recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may increase our understanding of the complex biology of this disease. METHODS: Tumor samples were obtained from untreated HNSCC patients undergoing surgery. Patients were classified according to pathologic lymph node status (positive or negative) or tumor recurrence (recurrent or non-recurrent tumor) after treatment (surgery with neck dissection followed by radiotherapy). Using microarray gene expression, we screened tumor samples according to modules comprised by genes in the same pathway or functional category. RESULTS: The most frequent alterations were the repression of modules in negative lymph node (N0) and in non-recurrent tumors rather than induction of modules in N+ or in recurrent tumors. N0 tumors showed repression of modules that contain cell survival genes and in non-recurrent tumors cell-cell signaling and extracellular region modules were repressed. CONCLUSIONS: The repression of modules that contain cell survival genes in N0 tumors reinforces the important role that apoptosis plays in the regulation of metastasis. In addition, because tumor samples used here were not microdissected, tumor gene expression data are represented together with the stroma, which may reveal signaling between the microenvironment and tumor cells. For instance, in non-recurrent tumors, extracellular region module was repressed, indicating that the stroma and tumor cells may have fewer interactions, which disable metastasis development. Finally, the genes highlighted in our analysis can be implicated in more than one pathway or characteristic, suggesting that therapeutic approaches to prevent tumor progression should target more than one gene or pathway, specially apoptosis and interactions between tumor cells and the stroma.

161	FADD expression is associated with regional and distant metastasis in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	English	2013	23763459	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23763459	Journal Article	\N	177	114	63	59	\N	[24.0,90.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Cytoplasmic staining intensity was semiquantitatively scored as follows: negative (0); weakly positive (+); positive (++); or strongly positive (+++). Normal epithelium, which was present on most slides, stained weakly positive (+), and was used as an internal reference, as previously described. Cases with 0 or + staining were classiﬁed as low FADD, and cases with ++ and +++ staining as high FADD.	All 177 patients underwent surgery of the primary tumour, and in 151 cases this was combined with a neck dissection. All patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy based on pathological risk factors, such as positive surgical margins (68%), lymph node metastases with extranodal spread (33%), and/ or other adverse prognostic factors, such as advanced T-stage, multiple lymph node metastases, and/or perineural growth. None of the patients received postoperative chemoradiation at that time.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: The Fas-associated death domain gene (FADD) is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC), and is considered to be a driver gene in amplification of the chromosomal 11q13.3 region. Amplification of 11q13.3 is associated with increased metastasis in HNSCC and breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between FADD protein expression in advanced-stage HNSCC and clinicopathological features and outcome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Tumour tissues of 177 HNSCC patients uniformly treated with primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy were collected. FADD expression was assessed on pretreatment tumour biopsies using immunohistochemistry. High FADD expression was detected in 44% of the HNSCC patients. High expression was associated with an increased rate of lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001) and with a shorter distant metastasis-free interval (DMFI) (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-6.7, P = 0.046) when lymph node metastases were present. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that an increase in FADD expression is associated with a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis at presentation, and with shorter DMFI when lymph node metastases are present. High FADD expression in the primary tumour could be a useful marker to select patients for systemic treatment strategies that reduce the risk of distant metastases.

162	Biological and clinical significance of NAC1 expression in cervical carcinomas: a comparative study between squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas/ adenosquamous carcinomas	English	2012	21889186	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21889186	Journal Article	\N	80	\N	80	\N	\N	[26.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Stage I and II patients were treated with class II or III radical hysterectomies with pelvic lymph node dissection. Stage I patients with positive lymph node metastasis or positive lymphovascular space invasion and stage II patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy as adjuvant therapy. Stage III or IV patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	This study examined the biological and clinical significance of NAC1 (nucleus accumbens associated 1) expression in both cervical squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas. Using immunohistochemistry, the frequency of positive NAC1 expression in adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas (31.0%; 18/58) was significantly higher than that in squamous cell carcinomas (16.2%; 12/74) (P = .043). NAC1 gene amplification was identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 5 (7.2%) of 69 squamous cell carcinomas. NAC1 amplification was not identified in the adenocarcinomas (0%; 0/58). Positive NAC1 expression was significantly correlated with shorter overall survival in squamous cell carcinomas (P < .0001). A multivariate analysis showed that positive NAC1 expression in squamous cell carcinomas was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival after standard radiotherapy (P = .0003). In contrast to squamous cell carcinomas, positive NAC1 expression did not correlate with shorter overall survival in adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas (P = .317). Profound growth inhibition, increased apoptosis, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased cell migration and invasion were observed in silencing RNA-treated cancer cells with NAC1 overexpression compared with cancer cells without NAC1 expression. NAC1 overexpression stimulated proliferation, migration, and invasion in the cervical cancer cell lines TCS and Hela P3, which normally lack NAC1 expression. These findings indicate that NAC1 overexpression is critical to the growth and survival of cervical carcinomas irrespective of histologic type. Furthermore, they suggest that NAC1 silencing RNA-induced phenotypes depend on the expression status of the targeted cell line. Therefore, cervical carcinoma patients with NAC1 expression may benefit from a targeted therapy irrespective of histologic type.	Human Pathology	Stage I-II: 43 patients, Stage III-IV: 31 patients.
163	The value of FATS expression in predicting sensitivity to radiotherapy in breast cancer	English	2017	28402275	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28402275	Journal Article	\N	81	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	Among them, eighty-one patients with breast cancer, who with ≥ 4 positive axillary lymph nodes or with T3 tumors with positive axillary lymph nodes, or with operable stage III tumors, were subjected radiotherapy according to clinical guidelines.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The fragile-site associated tumor suppressor (FATS) is a newly identified tumor suppressor involved in radiation-induced tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to characterize FATS expression in breast cancers about radiotherapy benefit, patient characteristics, and prognosis. RESULTS: The expression of FATS mRNA was silent or downregulated in 95.2% of breast cancer samples compared with paired normal controls (P < .0001). Negative status of FATS was correlated with higher nuclear grade (P = .01) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS) of breast cancer (P = .036). In a multivariate analysis, FATS expression showed favorable prognostic value for DFS (odds ratio, 0.532; 95% confidence interval, 0.299 to 0.947; (P = .032). Furthermore, improved survival time was seen in FATS-positive patients receiving radiotherapy (P = .006). The results of multivariate analysis revealed independent prognostic value of FATS expression in predicting longer DFS (odds ratio, 0.377; 95% confidence interval, 0.176 to 0.809; P = 0.012) for patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. In support of this, reduction of FATS expression in breast cancer cell lines, FATS positive group significantly sensitized than Knock-down of FATS group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissue samples from 156 breast cancer patients and 42 controls in tumor bank were studied. FATS gene expression was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). FATS function was examined in breast cancer cell lines using siRNA knock-downs and colony forming assays after irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: FATS status is a biomarker in breast cancer to identify individuals likely to benefit from radiotherapy.	Oncotarget	Stage I: 12 patients, Stage II: 104 patients, Stage III: 36 patients.
228	Expression of Transketolase like gene 1 (TKTL1) predicts disease-free survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy	English	2011	21854597	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21854597	Journal Article	\N	33	23	10	61	\N	[33.0,76.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	All patients participated in clinical trials of intensified neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy including weekly irinotecan (40 - 50 mg/㎡) and cetuximab (initial dose of 400 mg/㎡then 250 mg/㎡), and daily capecitabine (400 - 500 mg/㎡ b.i.d.) in combination with pelvic radiotherapy (45 Gy + 5.4 Gy). All but one patient underwent curative surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended as standard therapy. So far, no predictive or prognostic molecular factors for patients undergoing multimodal treatment are established. Increased angiogenesis and altered tumour metabolism as adaption to hypoxic conditions in cancers play an important role in tumour progression and metastasis. Enhanced expression of Vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-receptor (VEGF-R) and Transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1) are related to hypoxic conditions in tumours. In search for potential prognostic molecular markers we investigated the expression of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and TKTL1 in patients with LARC treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and cetuximab. METHODS: Tumour and corresponding normal tissue from pre-therapeutic biopsies of 33 patients (m: 23, f: 10; median age: 61 years) with LARC treated in phase-I and II trials with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (cetuximab, irinotecan, capecitabine in combination with radiotherapy) were analysed by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Significantly higher expression of VEGFR-1/2 was found in tumour tissue in pre-treatment biopsies as well as in resected specimen after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy compared to corresponding normal tissue. High TKTL1 expression significantly correlated with disease free survival. None of the markers had influence on early response parameters such as tumour regression grading. There was no correlation of gene expression between the investigated markers. CONCLUSION: High TKTL-1 expression correlates with poor prognosis in terms of 3 year disease-free survival in patients with LARC treated with intensified neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and may therefore serve as a molecular prognostic marker which should be further evaluated in randomised clinical trials.

164	Overexpression of the PSAT1 Gene in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Is an Indicator of Poor Prognosis	English	2016	27326252	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27326252	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All 124 NPC patients received a complete course of 3-dimensional radiotherapy (3DRT) in a constant protocol and were regularly followed-up until death or loss. The mean follow-up duration was 3 years. Patients with stage II-IV disease received concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in southern China and Southeast Asia, but risk stratification and treatment outcome in NPC patients remain suboptimal. Our study identified and validated metabolic drivers that are relevant to the pathogenesis of NPC using a published transcriptome. Phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) is an enzyme that is involved in serine biosynthesis, and its overexpression is associated with colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. However, its expression has not been systemically evaluated in patients with NPC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated two public transcriptomes of NPC tissues and benign nasopharyngeal mucosal epithelial tissues that deposited in the NIH Gene Expression Omnibus database under accession number GSE34574 and GSE12452. We also performed immunohistochemical staining and assessment of PSAT1 in a total of 124 NPC patients received radiotherapy and were regularly followed-up until death or loss. The endpoints analyzed were local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 124 patients with NPC and found that high PSAT1 expression was associated with poor prognosis of NPC and indicator of advanced tumor stage. High PSAT1 expression also correlated with an aggressive clinical course, with significantly shorter DSS (HR= 2.856, 95% CI 1.599 to 5.101), DMFS (HR= 3.305, 95% CI 1.720 to 6.347), LRFS (HR= 2.834, 95% CI 1.376 to 5.835), and OS HR= 2.935, 95% CI 1.646-5.234) in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that PSAT1 is a potential prognostic biomarker and higher expression of PSAT1 is associated with a poor prognosis in NPC.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of the CSC markers CD44, MET, and SLC3A2, and hypoxia gene signatures were analyzed in the resected primary tumors using RT-PCR and nanoString technology in a multicenter retrospective cohort of 195 patients. CD44 protein expression was further analyzed in tissue microarrays. Primary endpoint was locoregional tumor control. RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that hypoxia-induced gene expression was significantly associated with a high risk of locoregional recurrence using the 15-gene signature (P = 0.010) or the 26-gene signature (P = 0.002). In multivariate analyses, in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative but not with HPV16 DNA-positive tumors the effect of hypoxia-induced genes on locoregional control was apparent (15-gene signature: HR 4.54, P = 0.006; 26-gene signature: HR 10.27, P = 0.024). Furthermore, MET, SLC3A2, CD44, and CD44 protein showed an association with locoregional tumor control in multivariate analyses (MET: HR 3.71, P = 0.016; SLC3A2: HR 8.54, P = 0.037; CD44: HR 3.36, P = 0.054; CD44 protein n/a because of no event in the CD44-negative group) in the HPV16 DNA-negative subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown for the first time that high hypoxia-induced gene expression and high CSC marker expression levels correlate with tumor recurrence after PORT-C in patients with HPV16 DNA-negative HNSCC. After validation in a currently ongoing prospective trial, these parameters may help to further stratify patients for individualized treatment de-escalation or intensification strategies.

166	The expression pattern of Ku correlates with tumor radiosensitivity and disease free survival in patients with rectal carcinoma	English	2002	12216085	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12216085	Journal Article	\N	96	68	28	60	59.6000000000000014	[28.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Median	A total of 180 consecutive patients with rectal carcinoma underwent preoperative radiation and surgical resection. The total dose of radiation delivered through a linear accelerator was 50 grays (Gy) in all patients, usually in doses of 2 Gy at each treatment, 5 times per week.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Preoperative radiotherapy reduces the rate of local recurrence and improves the chance of survival in patients with resectable, advanced rectal carcinoma. However, because not all tumors respond similarly to radiation, sorting out suitable patients is required to irradiate tumors rationally. The authors examined the possible role of Ku protein in determining tumor radiosensitivity and disease free survival in patients with rectal carcinoma. METHODS: The authors studied 96 patients with advanced rectal carcinoma. In preradiation biopsy specimens of tumor samples, the number of cells that were stained positive for Ku protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern of Ku protein was examined for an association between tumor radiosensitivity (which was determined according to T classification downstaging, complete pathologic response, or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) and disease free survival. RESULTS: There was a high degree of correlation between the percentage of cells that expressed the 70-kDa Ku protein (Ku70) and the 86-kDa Ku protein (Ku86) in the tumor sections (correlation coefficient = 0.85; P < 0.001). The expression pattern of Ku protein was correlated not only with tumor radiosensitivity but also with disease free survival. Pathologic TMN classification, histopathologic grade, and Ku70 expression were significant prognostic variables for disease free survival in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.0031, P = 0.030, and P = 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ku70 and Ku86 raise the predictive possibility of tumor radiosensitivity. Ku may be a useful parameter for selecting patients with rectal carcinoma for preoperative radiotherapy.

167	Brachytherapy for oral tongue cancer: an analysis of treatment results with various biological markers	English	2008	18573850	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18573850	Journal Article	\N	68	40	28	65	\N	[24.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All 68 patients were treated by LDR (Low-dose-rate) brachytherapy alone. The prescribed dose was 65-70 Gy over a period of 6-7 days when LDR brachytherapy alone was used. Nine patients had positive neck lymph nodes (N1 or N2). These patients did not hope to be treated with glossectomy. The radical or modiﬁed neck lymph node resection was performed after LDR brachytherapy to the primary tumor.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: Low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy is an effective treatment for tongue cancer. However, little is known about the biological mechanism underlying this therapy, characterized by delivery of continuous exposures of LDR irradiation. It is reported that lower microvessel density (MVD), lower Ki-67 index or higher expression of endogenous hypoxic markers such as carbonic CA IX and Glut-1 are related to the poor control of tumors treated with external irradiation. To elucidate the biological characteristics of LDR brachytherapy, we analyzed our results in cases of tongue cancer treated with LDR brachytherapy by using immunohistochemical stainings with antibodies against Ki-67 and MVD, Glut-1 and CA IX. METHODS: The prognostic value of Ki-67 index, MVD and the expression of CA IX and Glut-1 was assessed in 68 tongue cancers treated with LDR brachytherapy. The specimens were taken from tongue cancers before radiation therapy and immunohistochemical staining was performed. RESULTS: The local recurrence-free survival rates were significantly different between T1+T2 and T3 (P = 0.00067), but not between low and high Ki-67 indexes (P = 0.54), between low and high MVD (P = 0.071), low and high CA IX indexes (P = 0.062) or low and high Glut-1 indexes (P = 0.107). T stage, the size of the tumor was the only significant factor for local control in multivariate analyses (P = 0.0377). CONCLUSION: LDR could overcome the radioresistence of non-cycling and hypoxic cells; however, we cannot draw firm conclusions due to the limited number of patients.

171	ERCC1 expression and outcomes in head and neck cancer treated with concurrent cisplatin and radiation	English	2011	22199271	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199271	Journal Article	\N	73	\N	\N	59	\N	[41.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	ERCC1 scoring was determined by two pathologists who were blinded to clinical data. ERCC1 stain scoring was as follows: 0=0% of tumor nuclei were positive, 1+ = less than 50% of tumor nuclei positive, 2+ = 50-75% nuclei positive and 3+ = 75-100% nuclei positive.	All patients treated with curative intent concurrent cisplatin and radiation. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of cisplatin with or without 5-fluorouracil, and patients were included if they received at least one dose of cisplatin. Those treated with carboplatin were excluded.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Overexpression of excision repair cross complementing group 1 (ERCC1), a DNA repair enzyme, is associated with resistance to cisplatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tissues from 73 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) who received concurrent cisplatin and radiation was analyzed immunohistochemically to determine if ERCC1 expression predicted for survival and response. Expression was scored as follows: 0=0% tumor nuclei positive, 1+=<50%, 2+=50-75% and 3+=>75%. RESULTS: ERCC1 expression was 0 in 0%, 1+ (14%), 2+ (42%) and 3+ (44%). In uni- and multivariate analyses, 3+ ERCC1 expression was not a significant predictor of survival or response. Median survival for the ERCC1 3+ patients was 2.9 years versus 2.1 years for the ERCC1 <3+ group (p=0.44). CONCLUSION: In this retrospective review of HNSCC patients receiving concurrent cisplatin and radiation, ERCC1 expression was not a significant predictor of survival or response.

172	Expression of ERCC1 and class III beta-tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with a combination of cisplatin/docetaxel and concurrent thoracic irradiation	English	2009	19123003	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19123003	Journal Article	\N	34	28	6	66.5	\N	[46.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The extent of immunohistological staining for ERCC1 was deWned as fellows: scores of 2+ or 3+ were regarded as positive, and scores of 0 or 1+ were regarded as negative. The extent of immunohistological staining for TUBB3 was defined as fellows: scores of 3+ or 4+ were regarded as positive, and scores of 0 or 1+ or 2+ were regarded as negative.	All patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (70 mg/㎡) and docetaxel (25 mg/㎡), given on days 1 and 8. Patients received at least two cycles of che- motherapy with an interval of 3-4 weeks. After these cycles, cisplatin (80 mg/㎡) and docetaxel (60 mg/㎡) were given on day 1 at an interval of 3-4 weeks. Thoracic radiotherapy was administered from day 8 of chemotherapy using a linear accelerator in 2-Gy single daily fractions for five consecutive days each week. A total radiation dose of 60 Gy was planned. Patients showing a good response after completion of 40 Gy of radiotherapy underwent surgical resection of their tumors.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: The expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) is reported to be correlated with resistance to platinum-based drugs. Class III beta-tubulin is reported to be correlated with resistance to taxanes. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated whether ERCC1 and class III beta-tubulin expression could be used to predict progression-free and/or overall survival in 34 patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving concurrent chemoradiation therapy with cisplatin and docetaxel, and immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of these two proteins in tumor samples obtained from the patients. RESULTS: Immunostaining for ERCC1 and class III beta-tubulin was positive in 16 and 12 patients, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between ERCC1 expression and response to chemotherapy (P = 0.012), and between class III beta-tubulin expression and histology (P = 0.029). Patients negative for ERCC1 had a significantly longer median progression-free (62.5 vs. 36 weeks, P = 0.009), but not overall (171 vs. 50.5 weeks, P = 0.208), survival than those positive for ERCC1. Expression of class III beta-tubulin was not correlated with progression-free or overall survival (P = 0.563 and P = 0.265, respectively). Multivariate analysis adjusting for possible confounding factors showed that negative ERCC1 expression (hazard ratio = 3.972, P = 0.009) was a significantly favorable factor for progression-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective study indicates that immunostaining for ERCC1 may be useful for predicting survival in NSCLC patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and docetaxel, and can provide information critical for planning personalized chemotherapy.

173	ERCC1 expression as a prognostic marker in N2(+) nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2008	18623378	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18623378	Journal Article	\N	68	48	20	58	\N	[33.0,72.0)	Immunohistochemistry	ERCC1-positive tumors were defined as more than the median value of all the H scores.	Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy included chemotherapy and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of weekly paclitaxel (50 mg/㎡ per week intravenously [iv]) or docetaxel (20 mg/㎡per week iv) plus cisplatin (25 mg/㎡ per week iv) or carboplatin (AUC 1.5/week iv) for 5 weeks (from March 2001 to September 2003) and cisplatin (60-100 mg/㎡ iv, Day 1) plus oral etoposide (50 mg/㎡ per os, Day 1-14) every 4 weeks (from September 1997 to March 2001). The radiation dose was 45 grays (Gy) over 5 weeks (1.8 Gy/fraction per day, 5 fractions/ week) using 10-MV x-rays. Surgical resection was planned at around 4 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant CCRT. Postoperative radiation therapy (18 Gy in 10 fractions) was administered in the event of persistent histologically positive N2 lymph nodes, positive multi-N1 lymph nodes, or a positive resection margin at the time of surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Excision repair cross-complementation Group 1 (ERCC1) overexpression is associated with resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A preliminary study also suggested that ERCC1 expression is associated with radioresistance in lung cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical implications of ERCC1 expression in stage IIIA N2-positive NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with mediastinoscopy-proven N2-positive NSCLC were enrolled between August 1997 and September 2003. ERCC1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry from pretreatment mediastinoscopic biopsy specimens. RESULTS: ERCC1 expression was positive in 31 of 68 specimens (46%). Among 14 patients who obtained pathologic complete response, 6 were positive for ERCC1 expression and 8 were negative (P = .818). On univariate analysis, with median follow-up of 61.8 months (range, 34.3-108.8 months), progression-free survival was 15.9 months for ERCC1-positive and 29.5 months for ERCC1-negative patients (P = .062), and there was a statistically significant difference in overall survival between ERCC1-negative tumors and ERCC1-positive tumors (89.2 vs 26.0 months, P = .014). On multivariate analysis, ERCC1 negativity (P = .041) and achieving mediastinal nodal clearance (downstage to pathological N0 or N1) after neoadjuvant CCRT followed by surgery (P = .005) were significant independent prognostic factors for the prolongation of survival. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that N2-positive NSCLC patients with ERCC1 negative tumors show a survival benefit from neoadjuvant CCRT with a platinum-containing regimen.

All patients received conventional fractionation, 1.80 Gy/day, 5 fractions per week to a total dose of 45 Gy. In 5 patients, a 5.4-Gy boost to the tumor was given. Twenty-one patients received simultaneous chemotherapy: 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU), 350 mg/square meter i.v. bolus 1 h before radiotherapy on Days 1-5 and Days 29-33; and leucovorin calcium, 20 mg/square meter i.v. bolus immediately before each dose of 5-FU. The median time between radiotherapy and surgery was 33 days.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression is observed in 50%-70% of colorectal carcinomas and is associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to determine the EGFR expression rate in locally advanced rectal cancer and to analyze whether EGFR expression predicts tumor response to preoperative radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between December 1997 and October 2000, 45 patients were included. Treatment consisted of preoperative pelvic radiotherapy and, in 21 patients, 2 courses of 5-fluorouracil leucovorin. Surgical resection was performed 4-8 weeks later. Immunohistochemistry for EGFR was determined at the preradiation diagnostic biopsy and in the resected specimens. Immunostaining was performed using EGFR monoclonal antibody (Biogenex, MU 207-UC). Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated according to extension and intensity. We defined positive staining (EGFR+) as extension of 5% or more. RESULTS: Preoperative treatment resulted in pathologic complete remission in 7 patients (15%), downstaging in 13 patients (29%), and no response in 25 patients (56%). EGFR+ was observed in 29 of 45 tumors (64%) and was associated with neither clinical tumor stage nor clinical nodal stage. The overall response rate was 34% in EGFR+ patients vs. 62% in those who were EGFR- (p = 0.07). Only 1 of the 7 pathologic complete remission patients was EGFR+ (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR is expressed in a significant number of locally advanced rectal tumors. EGFR expression is an indicator for poor response to preoperative radiotherapy in advanced rectal carcinoma.

175	An analysis of p53, BAX and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in node-positive rectal cancer. Relationships with tumour recurrence and event-free survival of patients treatedwith adjuvant chemoradiation	English	2002	11875737	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11875737	Journal Article	\N	79	44	35	65	\N	[48.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	BAX and TP53 expressions were classiﬁed as negative (none or ≤10% of tumour cells stained) and positive (>10% of tumour cells stained). VEGF expression was scored as percentage of immunoreactive cells and each case was categorized as positive (>10% of tumour cells stained) or negative (none or ≤10% of tumour cells stained).	For the purpose of the analysis, patients had to be treated with a homogeneous adjuvant protocol based on six chemotherapy cycles with bolus ﬂuorouracil/folinic and pelvic radiation 45 Gy, with a boost to a total of 54 Gy. Patients underwent curative surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Tumours of patients with node-positive rectal cancer were studied by immunohistochemistry for p53, BAX and vascular endothelial growth factor expressions. Results were correlated to the relapse rate, the pattern of relapse and the event-free survival after radical surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation. After a median follow-up of 60 months, 39 patients remained disease-free and 40 patients relapsed (18 local relapses and 22 distant metastases). The majority of disease-free patients showed p53 negative and vascular endothelial growth factor negative tumours. Local relapses occurred more frequently in patients with p53 overexpressing tumours (P<0.01), while distant metastases were in patients with vascular endothelial growth factor positive tumours (P<0.003). Patients with p53 negative or vascular endothelial growth factor negative tumours showed better event-free survival than patients with p53 positive or vascular endothelial growth factor positive tumours. BAX analysis did not show any association with patients' outcome and it was unrelated to the p53 status. Adjuvant treatment strategies for node-positive rectal cancer may be improved by identifying categories of high-risk patients. In this study, vascular endothelial growth factor and p53 expressions correlated with recurrent disease, pattern of relapse and poor event-free survival.

English	2005	15967033	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15967033	Journal Article	\N	77	51	26	64	\N	[30.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The cut-off of 25% of EGFR staining corresponded to the third quartile of EGFR extent and was then selected for all statistical correlations.	Patients were treated in supine position with a 3-field (posterior and two opposed laterals) isocentric technique using 18-MV photon beams daily, five times a week. The daily dose at the isocenter was 2 Gy; the total dose to the entire pelvis was 44 Gy. In 25 very low-rectal-cancer patients, primary tumor received a boost dose of up to 16 Gy for a sphincter-preservation approach. Thirteen patients (17%) received concomitant chemotherapy. In eight patients, the chemotherapy regimen consisted of continuous infusion of 200–250 mg/㎡/day of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alone beginning on the first day of radiation therapy, five days a week for 5 weeks. Oxaliplatin (40 mg/㎡/day at days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29) and leucovorin (100 mg/㎡/day at days 1–2, 15–16, and 29–30) were added at the same protocol of 5-FU for two and three patients, respectively. Median time between the last day of radiotherapy and surgery was 41 days (range: 13–97). The choice of the surgical procedure was at the surgeon's discretion.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represents a major target for current radiosensitizing strategies. We wished to ascertain whether a correlation exists between the expression of EGFR and treatment outcome in a group of patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who had undergone preoperative radiotherapy (RT). METHODS: Within a six-year period, 138 patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy and curative surgery for rectal cancer (UICC stages II-III) at our institute. Among them, 77 pretherapeutic tumor biopsies were available for semi-quantitative immunohistochemical investigation evaluating the intensity and the number (extent) of tumor stained cells. Statistical analyses included Cox regression for calculating risk ratios of survival endpoints and logistic regression for determining odds ratios for the development of loco-regional recurrences. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years (range: 30-88). Initial staging showed 75% and 25% stage II and III tumors, respectively. RT consisted of 44-Gy pelvic irradiation in 2-Gy fractions using 18-MV photons. In 25 very low-rectal-cancer patients the primary tumor received a boost dose of up to 16 Gy for a sphincter-preservation approach. Concomitant chemotherapy was used in 17% of the cases. All patients underwent complete total mesorectal resection. Positive staining (EGFR+) was observed in 43 patients (56%). Median follow-up was 36 months (range: 6-86). Locoregional recurrence rates were 7 and 20% for EGFR extent inferior and superior to 25%, respectively. The corresponding locoregional recurrence-free survival rate at two years was 94% (95% confidence interval, CI, 92-98%) and 84% (CI 95%, 58-95%), respectively (P = 0.06). Multivariate analyses showed a significant correlation between the rate of loco-regional recurrence and three parameters: EGFR extent superior to 25% (hazard ratio = 7.18, CI 95%, 1.17-46, P = 0.037), rectal resection with microscopic residue (hazard ratio = 6.92, CI 95%, 1.18-40.41, P = 0.032), and a total dose of 44 Gy (hazard ratio = 5.78, CI 95%, 1.04-32.05, P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: EGFR expression impacts on loco-regional recurrence. Knowledge of expression of EGFR in rectal cancer could contribute to the identification of patients with an increased risk of recurrences, and to the prediction of prognosis.

The IRS was determined by considering the inten- sity (graded on a scale of 0-3; 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3, strong staining) and extent (percentage of positive tumor cells) of staining. The staining extent was graded on a scale of 0-4 (0, no staining; 1, 1-25%; 2, 26-50%; 3, 51-75%; and 4, 76-100%). An IRS (range, 0-7) was obtained by adding the two parameters. The cutoff level of EGFR expression was deﬁned as a dichotomous variable of low expression (IRS 0-3) or high expression (IRS 4-7).	Preoperative chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy. Between July 1993 and June 1999, 94 patients re- ceived two cycles of intravenous bolus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/d) and leucovorin (LV) (20 mg/㎡/d) for 5 days each, on the ﬁrst and ﬁfth weeks of pelvic radiotherapy. Between July 1999 and June 2002, 89 patients received oral chemotherapy consisting of two cycles of capecitabine and LV. Capecitabine was given orally at a dose of 1650 mg/㎡/d, diveided into two doses. One cycle of oral chemotherapy was continued for 14 days, was followed by a 7-day rest period. Approximately 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, the patients underwent deﬁnitive surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To examine retrospectively whether levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression can predict tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 183 patients with rectal cancer (cT3-T4 or N+) were enrolled in this study. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy consisted of 50.4 Gy of pelvic radiation with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin bolus intravenous chemotherapy in 94 patients or oral capecitabine and leucovorin in 89 patients. EGFR expression in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor biopsy specimens was assessed by immunohistochemistry. EGFR expression was determined from the intensity and extent of staining. Tumor downstaging was defined as a reduction of at least one T-stage level. RESULTS: Tumor downstaging occurred in 97 patients (53%), and the tumors showed a pathologic complete response in 27 patients (15%). Positive EGFR expression was observed in 140 (76%) of 183 patients. EGFR expression levels were low in 113 patients (62%) and high in 70 patients (38%). On logistic regression analysis, the significant predictive factor for increased tumor downstaging was a low level of EGFR expression and preoperative chemotherapy using oral capecitabine (odds ratio, 0.437; p = 0.012 vs. odds ratio, 3.235; p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: A high level of EGFR expression may be a significant predictive molecular marker for decreased tumor downstaging after preoperative chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer.

178	Epidermal growth factor receptor as a prognostic factor in locally advanced rectal-cancerpatients treated with preoperative chemoradiation	English	2006	16690221	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16690221	Journal Article	\N	92	56	36	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The IRS was determined by considering both the intensity of staining (scored on a 0 to 3 scale, where 0 = no staining, 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining, and 3 = strong staining) and the extent of staining (the percentage of positive tumor cells). The staining extent was scored on a 0 to 4 scale, where 0 = no staining, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, and 4 = 76% to 100%. The IRS, which ranged from 0 to 7, was obtained by adding the 2 parameters. To examine the prognostic importance of EGFR expression for survival between patients with negative to moderate expression levels and those with high expression levels, the cutoff level for EGFR expression was deﬁned by a dichotomous variable, low expression (IRS 0 to 5) or high expression (IRS 6 to 7).	Radiation was delivered with 6-MV and 10-MV photons, by use of a 3-ﬁeld technique (posterior and both laterals) in most patients. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days per week, once per day, at 1.8 Gy per day. The pelvic radiotherapy consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, which was followed by a boost dose of 5.4 Gy, administered in 3 fractions to the primary tumor by 2 lateral ﬁelds. Preoperative chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiation therapy and consisted of 2 cycles of i.v. bolus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡/day) for 5 days each. Each cycle of chemotherapy was administered concurrently in an outpatient setting on the 1st and 5th weeks of pelvic preoperative radiotherapy. Approximately 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, the patients underwent definitive surgery. The surgical management included a sphincter preservation approach whenever possible, by use of the totalmesorectal excision technique.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: We investigated the prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Pretreatment biopsy specimens from 92 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer were examined for EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry. EGFR expression was assessed by immunoreactive score (IRS). The prognostic value of EGFR expression was evaluated according to the level of EGFR expression. RESULTS: Epidermal growth factor receptor expression was positive in 65 patients (71%). EGFR expression levels were low (IRS 0 to 5) in 83 patients (90%) and high (IRS 6 to 7) in 9 patients (10%). A high level of EGFR expression was statistically significant for shorter overall survival (p = 0.013), disease-free survival (p = 0.002), and distant metastasis-free survival (p = 0.003), as compared with a low level of expression in univariate analysis. Grouping based on positive or negative EGFR expression did not represent prognostic significance for survival. In multivariate analysis, high EGFR expression was an independent prognostic factor for decreased disease-free survival (relative risk 2.4, p = 0.041) and distant metastasis-free survival (relative risk 2.6, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that high level of EGFR expression in a pretreatment biopsy specimen may be a significant adverse prognostic factor for disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival.

179	A prospective study of p53 expression and its correlation with clinical response of radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2001	11192881	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11192881	Journal Article	\N	68	50	18	\N	48.5	[17.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The TP53 expression in more than 10% of the tumor cells immunostained were defined as positive.	All patients received a radiation dose of 7000 cGy in 35 fractions, five fractions a week.	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignant neoplasm of the head and neck that occurs in people in the southeastern Asian area, including Taiwan. The significant association of p53 expression in NPC suggested that p53 overexpression seemed to occur at an early stage in the development of NPC. Alterations of p53 status were probably the most commonly encountered in head and neck carcinomas, and there was extensive evidence that p53 status might determine tumor response to therapy. Ionizing radiation was studied extensively for the relationship between its damaging effect and p53 status in human cancer cells. STUDY DESIGN: This study was carried out to investigate whether there was any correlation between overexpression of p53 protein and locoregional tumor response in patients with NPC treated with 7000 cGy of radiotherapy. METHODS: Sixty-eight patients (50 males, 18 females) with NPC who were diagnosed and treated with radiotherapy were studied prospectively. Before they had received a radiation dose of 7000 cGy in 35 fractions, five fractions a week, p53 status from a nasopharyngeal biopsy was studied using immunohistochemical staining (IHC). RESULTS: The locoregional response rate of primary tumor was analyzed statistically. Forty-seven patients (69.1%) showed positive p53 staining in their tumors. There were 5 positive stains in 6 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC; 83.3%), 34 positive in 53 non-keratinizing carcinomas (NKC; 64.2%), and 8 positive in 9 undifferentiated carcinomas (UC; 88.9%). The mean ages for patients with three different histopathologies were 48.5, 46.1, and 61.1 years. There were 8 patients (7 positive stains, 1 negative stain) with residual tumor after radiotherapy and all were NKC (6 males, 2 females). Therefore, the clinical response rate of primary tumor was 85.1% in positive p53 immunostaining (40 of 47 cases), 95.2% in those with no immunostaining (20 of 21 cases); the former was poorer in locoregional tumor response than the latter, but there was no significant difference (P > .05, chi2 test). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no statistically significant correlation in locoregional response of primary tumor between p53 overexpression and radiotherapy in patients with NPC (P > .05, Fisher exact test).

180	Prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2000	10811669	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10811669	Journal Article	White; Black	56	46	10	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	VEGFA staining intensity (0 = none, 1 = faint and focal, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong, and 4 = intense) and percent distribution. For the analysis presented in this article, tumor VEGFA positivity was deﬁned as strong or intense immunohistochemical staining.	All patients were treated with gross total surgical resection and postoperative external-beam radiotherapy to a median dose of 60 Gy. Final surgical margins were negative in 42 patients (75%). Forty-nine patients (88%) received a radical or modiﬁed neck dissection. Eleven patients (20%) received adjuvant chemotherapy with the hypoxic cytotoxins mitomycin or porfiromycin as part of an experimental protocol. Five patients (9%) received intraoperative brachytherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis in many different tumor types. VEGF levels may affect tumor growth, metastatic potential, and response to radiotherapy. This study assesses the prognostic value of VEGF protein levels in a cohort of patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. The relationships between clinical outcome and the covariables of tumor-node-metastasis stage, disease stage (I to IV), grade, margin status, race, sex, and age were also determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chart review identified 77 patients with oral or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with gross total surgical resection and postoperative radiation between 1981 and 1992. Sufficient follow-up data and tumor tissue were available in 56 patients (73%). VEGF protein levels were determined using immunohistochemistry. The association between VEGF status, covariables, and outcome was assessed in a bivariate and multivariate model using two-sided statistical tests. RESULTS: Twenty-three tumors (41%) were positive for VEGF expression. VEGF-positive tumors were more likely to recur locally (relative risk [RR] = 3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 9.24) and distantly (RR = 4.62; 95% CI, 1.41 to 15.10). In bivariate analysis, VEGF positivity was the most significant predictor of poor disease-free survival (RR = 2.66; 95% CI, 1.27 to 5.56) and overall survival (RR = 3.21; 95% CI, 1.63 to 6.32). In multivariate analysis, VEGF positivity was the most significant predictor of poor disease-free survival (RR = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.30 to 5.79) and overall survival (RR = 3.53; 95% CI, 1.75 to 7.13). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, VEGF positivity was the most significant predictor of poor prognosis. VEGF status may prove to be an important prognostic factor in head and neck cancer.

211	The influence of HPV-associated p16-expression on accelerated fractionated radiotherapy in head and neck cancer: evaluation of the randomised DAHANCA 6&7 trial	English	2011	21429609	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21429609	Journal Article	\N	794	648	146	61	\N	[20.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumours were classiﬁed dichotomously as either CDKN2A-positive (strong, diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmatic staining in more than 10% of carcinoma cells) or CDKN2A-negative.	In both treatment-groups radiotherapy was delivered in fractions of 2 Gy with a minimum tumour dose of 66-68 Gy, dependent on tumour and lymphnode size. Well-differentiated stage I glottic carcinomas could be treated with only 62 Gy though. In addition all patients, except for glottic tumours, received the hypoxic cell radiosensitiser nimorazole (1200 mg/㎡) in combination with the ﬁrst 30 fractions. Adherence to radiotherapy was identical in the two treatment groups, with 98% of patients receiving the scheduled dose and 75% of patients received >25 treatments of nimorazole.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tumour HPV-positivity is a favourable prognostic factor in the radiotherapy of HNSCC, but the optimal radiotherapy regimen for HPV-positive HNSCC is not yet defined. Reducing overall treatment time is known to improve outcome in the radiotherapy of HNSCC as was also demonstrated in the randomised DAHANCA 6&7 trial. We aimed to assess the influence of tumour HPV-status, expressed by p16, on the response to accelerated fractionated radiotherapy in HNSCC through evaluation of the DAHANCA 6&7 trial. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical detection of HPV-associated p16-expression was performed on FFPE-pre-treatment tumour-tissues from 794 patients enrolled in the DAHANCA 6&7 trial. The influence of tumour p16-status on loco-regional tumour control and survival as a function of fractionation schedule (5Fx/week vs 6Fx/week) was evaluated 5years after the completion of radiotherapy. RESULTS: The significant and independent prognostic value of tumour p16-positivity in HNSCC radiotherapy was confirmed, with adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of 0.58 [0.43-0.78], 0.47 [0.33-0.67] and 0.54 [0.42-0.68] for loco-regional control, disease-specific and overall survival, respectively. Accelerated radiotherapy significantly improved loco-regional tumour control compared to conventional radiotherapy, adjusted HR: 0.73 [0.59-0.92] and the benefit of the 6Fx/week regimen was observed both in p16-positive (HR: 0.56 [0.33-0.96]) as well as in p16-negative tumours (HR: 0.77 [0.60-0.99]). Disease-specific survival was also significantly improved with accelerated radiotherapy in the group of p16-positive tumours (adjusted HR: 0.43 [0.22-0.82]). CONCLUSION: Accelerated radiotherapy significantly improves outcome in HNSCC compared to conventional fractionation. The observed benefit is independent of tumour p16-status and the use of a moderately accelerated radiotherapy regimen seems advantageous also for HPV/p16-positive HNSCC.

181	Prognostic value of Survivin and Livin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2006	16481824	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16481824	Journal Article	\N	80	59	21	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All 80 patients were treated with standard curative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Survivin and Livin are new members from the family of anti-apoptotic factors. Increased levels of Survivin and Livin have been observed in many malignancies and correlated with poor prognosis. Survivin is expressed almost exclusively in proliferating cells, including various kinds of cancers, but Livin expression is relatively rare in cancer cells. Therefore, the present study examines the expressions of Survivin and Livin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and investigates whether their expression contributes to the prognosis of NPC. METHODS: We investigated the expression of Survivin and Livin in 80 NPC samples using immunohistochemistry stain and correlated it with the survival of these patients using log-rank test and Cox multifactor regression analysis. RESULTS: All the patients were followed up at least for 60 months. During the following period, 21 cases developed distant metastasis, 9 cases developed local-regional recurrence, and 5 developed both distant metastasis and local-regional recurrence. Among them, 30 patients died of recurrence of tumor. In addition, the expression of Survivin was related with distant metastasis. Patients with low Survivin expression had better overall survival, disease-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival rates than the group with high Survivin expression (P = .0086, .0097, and .0318, respectively). Cox regression analysis confirmed that high Survivin expression was related to worse prognosis in NPC patients. However Livin expression level was not related with the survival of patients with NPC. CONCLUSION: NPC expresses high levels of Survivin and Livin, which may play an important role in the oncogenesis and tumor development. Over-expression of Survivin was related with poor prognosis. We suggest that the determination of Survivin expression may provide predictive information on NPC patients.	The Laryngoscope	Stage II: 19 patients, Stage III: 32 patients, Stage IVA-B: 29 patients.

METHODS: The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 62 patients with NKTL proven by pathology were collected. Paraffin-embedded tissue sections were examined for mdm2, p53, p21 and LMP-1 proteins by tissue microarray technique and immunohistochemistry. In situ hybridization was used to detect EBER1/2. RESULTS: The positive expression rates of mdm2, p53, p21 and LMP-1 proteins in NKTL were 61.3%, 79.0%, 58.1% and 48.4%, respectively, and EBER1/2 was 90.3%. The positive expression rates of mdm2 in Ann Arbor stage I, II, III and IV NKTL were 43.5%, 62.5%, 73.3% and 87.5%, respectively; p53 were 69.6%, 75.0%, 86.7% and 100.0%; p21 were 47.8%, 56.3%, 60.0% and 87.5%; while those of LMP-1 were 60.9%, 50.0%, 26.7% and 50.0%, respectively. With the progression of tumor, the positive expression rates of mdm2, p53 and p21 proteins gradually increased. There were statistically significant differences between them (P<0.05). There were statistically positive correlations among those three genes (P<0.05). The prognosis of the positive expression group of these three genes was worse than that of negative expression group (P<0.05). No statistically significant difference was observed between the expression of LMP-1 protein and the clinical stage or prognosis (P>0.05). The expression of p53 protein was an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: The expression of mdm2, p53 and p21 proteins is closely related with the pathogenesis and progression of NKTL. They are good markers for judgement of the biological behavior of NKTL. The expression of p53 protein is an independent prognostic factor. Though no significant relationship was found between the expression of LMP-1 protein and the clinical stage or prognosis, it may play some role in tumor progression.

Pre-operatively, concurrent chemoradiotherapy was given at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks and a 24-h continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil (300 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5, repeated every week for 5 weeks) was administered. Radiotherapy with standard 4- ﬁeld box technique was used. Chemotherapy as part of neoadjuvant treatment was omitted for patients at the stage of T1-2N0M0. Low abdominal resection (LAR) or abdomino-perineal resection (APR) was performed 4 weeks after completion of the neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered 3 weeks after surgery if the pathological stage of the tumor was beyond T3 or N1. The regimens were as follows: intravenous bolus of 5-filuorouracil 370 mg/㎡/day and leucovorin 20 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 every 28 days for 6 courses.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Our aim was to examine whether certain molecular markers, specifically p53, p21, p27, and Bcl-2, could be used to predict the tumor response of rectal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy and determine the overall and disease-free survival rates of patients following neoadjuvant therapy. Seventy-seven patients with rectal cancers were used in this study. All of them received neoadjuvant therapy and 53 of them were given radical surgery. Immunohistochemical tests were performed for the four markers mentioned above using biopsy specimens obtained from 70 of the patients prior to radiation. The identical tests were performed for the same markers using excised specimens from the patients after radical surgery. For the pre-radiation specimens, the positive rate for having p27 and Bcl-2 markers was 32.7% and 16.6%, respectively. This rate increased to 73.5% and 41.6% (p=0.001 and 0.012, respectively) in the specimens obtained after the surgery. With respect to "fair response (FR)" of patients, the pre-radiation biopsy specimens showed significant difference for the p53 (-) and p27 (+) markers (p=0.006). Patients with a 3-year overall survival rate were found to have, from their surgical specimens, 92% of the p27 (+) and 75% of p27 (-) markers (p=0.0058). Our study showed: first, the rate of positive identification of molecular markers, p27 and Bcl-2, increased following neoadjuvant therapy. Second, either the p53 (-) or p27 (+) status was a good predictor for FR in the pre-radiation biopsy specimens. Third, patients with p27 (+) markers in the surgical specimens lived longer at 3 years.

METHODS: The expression fo p16 gene was determined by immunohistochemistry in 68 specimens of advaned NSCLC. All patients received total 55 Gy of conventional irradiation. The correlation between the p16 gene expression and the effect radiatherapy was analyzed. RESULTS: The negative expression of p16 gene existed in 57.4% of advanced NSCLC, and correlated with the differentiation of the cancer cells. The radiotherapy efficacy in the p16-positive group was superior to that in the p16-negative group (P<0.05), which demonstrasted that the p16 expression closely related to the efficacy of radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: The high frequency of p16 inactivation exists in  advanced NSCLC, and is associated with the radiosensitivity. The detection of p16 expression may be helpful to the judgement of radiosensitivity and the prognosis of patients.	Chinese Clinical Oncology	Stage IIIB-IV: 68 patients.

Patients were treated between 2004 and 2012 with surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy consisted of elective irradiation of cervical nodes with a median dose of 50.4 Gy and a boost to the former tumour region and/or residual disease up to a total dose of 6066 Gy. Thermoplastic masks were used for immobilization and the treatment was applied by linear accelerators with energies  6 MeV using 3D-computer based or IMRT-planning. The median cumulative cisplatin dose was 200 mg/㎡.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	We examined the prognostic value of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after surgery and postoperative cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. FFPE-tissue originating from the surgery of 161 patients treated in 8 DKTK partner sites was immunohistochemically stained for CD3 and CD8. Their expression was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival (OS), local progression-free survival (LPFS) and distant metastases free-survival (DMFS), also in the context of the HPV16-DNA/p16 status. After a median follow-up of 48 months (range: 4100 months), OS at 4 years was 46.5% for the entire cohort. In multivariate analysis, high CD8 expression was confirmed as an independent prognostic parameter for OS (p = 0.002), LPFS (p = 0.004) and DMFS (p = 0.006), while CD3 expression lacked significance. In multivariate analysis HPV16 DNA positivity was associated with improved OS (p = 0.025) and LPFS (p = 0.013) and p16-positive patients showed improved DMFS (p = 0.008). Interestingly, high CD8 expression was a prognostic parameter for the clinical outcome in both HPV16 DNA-positive and HPV16 DNA-negative patients. Similar findings were observed in the multivariate analysis for the combined HPV16 DNA/p16 status. Altogether, CD8+ TILs constitute an independent prognostic marker in SCCHN patients treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. These data indicate that CD8-positive TILs have antitumour activity and could be used for treatment stratification. Further validation of the prognostic value of CD8+ TILs as a biomarker and its role in the immune response in SCCHN patients after adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is warranted and will be performed in the prospective DKTK-ROG study.

METHODS: Tumor samples were obtained from 85 children and youngster' patients with pathologically confirmed glioma at the Cancer Center of Sun Yat - Sen University. From Jan. 2000 Tto Fen. 2006 follow-up data were enrolled in this study, and all of the individuals with preliminary diagnosis received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The presence of ERCC1 and BMI-1 were measured by immunohistochemistry in 85 children and youngster's glioam tissues. The data were analyzed according to the clinic pathologic features and follow-up. RESULTS: Twenty-eight cases of 85 cases (32.9%)  showed high ERCC1 expression, and 32 cases of 85 cases (37.6) showed high BMI-1 expression. There were dramatic differences in BMI-1 expression between high and low graes of pathology (P=0.027). The number of BMI-1 positive cells were much more in low grade glioma than in high grade one. High expression of ERCC1 and BMI-1 were closely significant differences in overall survival between the high expression and low expression groups of ERCC1 (P=0.028) and BMI-1 (P=0.006). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis inidicated that histological grade, karnofsky performance status score, radiotherapeutic effect, and BMI-1 expression were all inidependent prognostic factors for overall survival (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ERCC1 and BMI-1 are closely related to the resistance of radiotherapy of glioma in children and youngsters. BMI-1 positive cell number is associated with the maligancy and prognosis of glioma, and its expression is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in children and youngsters.

METHODS: Expression of survivin was investigated by using the immunohistochemical staining method in 92 cases of NPC. Lite table, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were used in discussion the prognosis. RESULTS: The average positive rates of survivin in NPC was (37.24±30.94)%. Tumors were scored high expression when >25% cancer cells stained positive, thus the high expression of survivin was 56.52% (52/92). There were  no significant correlations between survivin and age, sex, primary tumor size, local-regional relapse and sistant metastasis, but high lymph node metastasis rate was seen in the high expression group of survivin. When analyzed for prognostic significance, patients with low survivin expression had bettwe overall survival than the group with high survivin expression (87.21% vs 52.28%, P=0.004). Cox regression analysis confirmed that high survivin expression was related to worse prognostic in NPC patients. CONSLUSIONS: There is high expression level of survivin in NPC, which may play an important role in the oncogenesis and tumoe development. Over expression of survivin is related to poor prognosis of NPC patients. The determination of survivin expression may provide predictive information on NPC patients.

Sixteen patients received 540 cGy boost to the tumor bed, and 51 patients received radiosensitizing chemotherapy. Twp patients did not complete the protocol because aof the development of radiation toxicity. Radical proctectomy was performed following the principles of sharp mesorectal excision using electrocautery.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the biologic significance of tumor response and the prognostic value of molecular markers in a group of patients with rectal cancer treated with preoperative radiation therapy and radical surgery. METHODS: Microsatellite instability, microvessel count, and immunohistochemistry for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p53, p21, bcl-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor were performed in the preradiation biopsy specimen of 72 patients with rectal cancer treated by preoperative radiation therapy and radical curative surgery. Preoperative tumor stage by endorectal ultrasound was compared with pathology stage of the resected specimen. Mean follow-up was 50 months. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (39 percent) responded to radiation therapy. The response was complete in 8 (12 percent) and partial in 20 patients (27 percent). Tumors with positive nodes in the surgical specimen were less likely to have responded to preoperative radiation (P = 0.03). Only p21 expression was individually associated with response to radiation (56 vs. 30 percent; P = 0.03). Tumors that were p53-negative/p21-positive or p21-positive/bcl-2-positive were also more likely to respond to radiation (83 vs. 35 percent; P = 0.03 and 71 vs. 31 percent; P = 0.01, respectively). The tumor relapsed in 21 patients (29 percent): locally in 7 (10 percent) and distally in 14 (19 percent). Recurrence was associated with lack of response to radiation, female gender, distal tumor location, high proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index, and low microvessel count. Probability of survival was greater for patients with well or moderately differentiated tumors and tumors that responded completely to radiation. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor response to radiation is associated with improved tumor control and overall survival rate, and p21 expression is a marker of tumor radiosensitivity in patients with rectal cancer. Furthermore, a high proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling index and a low microvessel count in the preradiation biopsy specimen may be prognostic indicators for tumor recurrence.

Tumors were scored as BCL2-negative if all or most of the malignant cells were unstained (<10% bcl-positive) and as BCL2- positive if >10%.	Radiotherapy (RT) was initiated 4-8 weeks after initial transurethral resection (TUR-B), using 10-MV photons and a 4-ﬁeld box technique with individually shaped portals and daily fractions of 1.8-2.0 Gy on ﬁve consecutive days per week. Following incomplete resection (R15 microscopic, R25 macroscopic residual tumor), the total dose prescribed to the true pelvis and the bladder was 54 Gy and 59.4 Gy, respectively. Concurrent cisplatin-chemotherapy was given immediately before each RT fraction on days 1-5 and 29-33 at a dose of 25 mg/㎡/d. In case of decreased creatinine clearance (<50 ml/min) carboplatin (65 mg/㎡/d) was applied in 18 patients. Six to eight weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, the response quality was evaluated by deep TUR-B of the former tumor bed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Several groups have reported the value of bladder preservation by a combined treatment protocol, including transurethral resection (TUR-B) and radiochemotherapy (RCT). As more experience is acquired with organ-sparing treatment, patient selection should be optimized. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of several biologic markers that may predict response to RCT in muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The apoptotic index (AI), Ki-67, p53, and bcl-2 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on pretreatment biopsies from 70 patients treated for invasive bladder cancer by TUR-B and RCT. Expression of each marker was correlated with initial response, local control, and cancer-specific survival with preserved bladder. An exploratory multivariate analysis was also performed that included clinical and immunohistochemical variables. RESULTS: A high AI (> median = 1.6%) and a high Ki-67 index (> median = 8.8%), but not the p53- and bcl-2 expression, were significantly related to initial complete response (CR) and local control with preserved bladder after 5 years. When the AI and Ki-67 expression were considered simultaneously, the association with initial CR (p < 0. 001), local control (p = 0.0002), and cancer-specific survival with preserved bladder (p = 0.008) was highly significant. In an exploratory multivariate analysis (final model), only AI, Ki-67, and the combined AI/Ki-67 variable retained significance for local control with preserved bladder at 5 years. CONCLUSION: Patients with a high spontaneous AI and a high pretreatment Ki-67 index should be considered preferentially for treatment with RCT, whereas tumors with low proliferation and low levels of apoptosis are less likely to respond to RCT.

Surgical resection was usually performed 4 weeks after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer is an important modality for curative resection, but tumors show wide spectrum response. The purpose of this study was to investigate any correlation among related genetic mutations, proliferative index, and tumor response after CCRT. METHODS: This study included 23 patients with rectal cancer, who were preoperatively staged as at least T3 N1 or T4 (determined by transrectal ultrasonography and MRI). Enrolled patients were given 5-FU 450 mg/m2/day and leucovorin 20 mg/m2/day intravenously for 5 days during weeks 1 and 5 of radiotherapy (45-54 Gy). Surgical resection was performed 4 weeks after completion of the scheduled treatment. Tumor response was classified as CR (complete response), PR (partial response: 50% diminution of tumor volume and downstaging), and NR (no response). Paraffin-embedded tissue obtained before chemoradiotherapy was studied by immunohistochemical staining for p53, BCL-2, and Ki-67. The extent of tumor response was correlated with proliferative activity and was measured by immunostaining Ki-67 proliferative antigen and the expression of p53 and BCL-2 oncoproteins. RESULTS: All patients were resectable. CR was obtained in 4 patients, PR in 10 patients, and NR in 9 patients. The p53 mutation was noted in 16 patients: NR in 5 patients, PR in 9 patients, and CR in 2 patients (P = .638). BCL-2 expression was noted in 11 patients: NR in 4 patients, PR in 3 patients, and CR in 4 patients (P = .799). The Ki-67 labeling index was NR: 615.4+/-47.2; PR: 663.2+/-20.4; and CR: 765.5+/-58.3 (CR + PR vs. NR, P = .029). CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical expression of p53 and BCL-2 does not correlate with tumor response after CCRT, but Ki-67 labeling may be a useful parameter for radiosensitive tumors selected for CCRT.

After 4 to 6 weeks, patients were subjected to radical surgery with a curative intent. During this study period patients were entered in prevailing protocols, thus intraoperative radiotherapy with a dose of 10 Gy was performed on 11 patients and postoperatively a weekly dose of 5-FU and leucovorin (450/20 mg/㎡) for a period of 12 weeks was given to 14 patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between survival and value of molecular markers in the primary tumour in a group of patients with irresectable rectal cancer, treated with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for p53, p21, bcl-2 and Ki-67 was performed on pre-treatment biopsy specimens of 34 patients with irresectable rectal cancer. Preoperative treatment consisted of pelvic irradiation of 45-56 Gy, combined with 5FU and leucovorin (350/20 mg/m2 x 5 d; in weeks 1 and 5 during radiotherapy). The median follow-up was 38 months. Endpoints were pathological T-stage and survival after surgery. RESULTS: Expression of p21 correlated significantly with survival (p=0.005). Survival and p21 expression also correlated significantly, when adjusted for tumour response (p=0.005, RR=4.8 (1.6-14.7)). CONCLUSION: Expression of p21 predicts a worse survival in irresectable rectal cancer treated with preoperative chemo-radiotherapy. No relationship was found between tumour response in chemo-radiotherapy and p53, bcl-2 or Ki-67.	Anticancer Research	\N

All patients received chemotherapy (continuous infusion of 5-FU for 6 weeks) and external beam radiation of 45 Gy in 30 fractions, followed by surgery 3-4 weeks later. Resected specimens were grossly evaluated and extensively sampled.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation (chemoradiation) are increasingly used in the treatment of advanced rectal carcinoma to downstage the tumor so that a sphincter sparing procedure is used. This treatment modality has also resulted in not only local disease control but also decreased metastasis and increased survival. It is well known that with standard chemoradiation some tumors show marked pathologic response, while others remain non-responsive. Identification of tumor markers that can predict responsiveness to chemoradiation is extremely useful to avoid unnecessary preoperative treatment. To understand the role of thymidylate synthase (TS), p53 and Bcl-2 proteins, if any, in tumor response/resistance to chemoradiation, we examined pretreatment biopsy material obtained from 12 responsive and 13 non-responsive patients by immunohistochemistry. TS was undetectable in 11 of 12 (92%) responsive tumors and overexpressed in only 1 tumor (8%); whereas, p53 or Bcl-2 was overexpressed in 8 tumors (66%). In the non-responsive group of 13 tumors, overexpression of TS, p53 and Bcl-2 was observed in 7, 5 and 6 tumors, respectively. In 6 non-responsive tumors in which TS was undetectable, 5 tumors contained high levels of p53 or Bcl-2. These results indicate that level of TS in tumors is the best predictor of sensitivity or resistance to chemoradiation. No such correlation between overexpression of p53 and Bcl-2 and response to chemoradiation is observed.	Oncology Reports	\N

All patients were treated with radiotherapy, and some had additional treatment of chemotherapy and/or surgery.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Apoptosis is one of the causes of cell death in cervical cancer following radiotherapy. By studying the gene expression profile with cDNA apoptotic array, the p73 gene was found overexpressed in radiosensitive cervical cancers when compared with radioresistant ones. To investigate the role of the p73 gene in relation to clinical assessment of radiosensitivity in cervical cancer based on the findings of residual tumor cells in cervical biopsies after completion of radiotherapy, we studied the protein expression of p73 in 59 cervical cancers after radiotherapy and 68 normal cervices using immunohistochemistry. The expression of p73 was found to be significantly increased in cancer samples and, more importantly, in those samples sensitive to radiotherapy (P < 0.001). The overexpression of p73 actually predicted a better prognosis in cervical cancer patients (P < 0.001). To investigate the possible involvement of p73 downstream genes, the protein expressions of p21 and Bax were studied. The expression of p21, but not Bax, was found to be positively correlated with the expression of p73 (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the epigenetic regulation of p73 expression via DNA methylation was also investigated in 103 cervical cancers and 124 normals. Hypermethylation of p73 gene was observed in 38.8% of cervical cancers, and it was significantly associated with reduced or absent p73 expression (P < 0.001). Reactivation of p73 expression in two cervical cancer cell lines by demethylation treatment supported the role of methylation in the regulation of p73 expression. Our findings suggested that p73 expression was related to the radiosensitivity of cervical cancer cells and may play an important role in the regulation of cellular radiosensitivity.

Radiotherapy had been delivered according to the standard protocols and consisted of elective irradiation of cervical nodes with a dose of ≥50 Gy and a boost to the former tumour region and/or residual disease up to a total dose of 60-66 Gy. The cumulative dose of cisplatin was ≥200 mg/㎡.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Despite clear differences in clinical presentation and outcome, squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN) arising from human papilloma virus (HPV) infection or heavy tobacco/alcohol consumption are treated equally. Next-generation sequencing is expected to reveal novel targets for more individualised treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumour specimens from 208 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity, all uniformly treated with adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiation, were included. A customised panel covering 211 exons from 45 genes frequently altered in SCCHN was used for detection of non-synonymous point and frameshift mutations. Mutations were correlated with HPV status and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Mutational profiles and HPV status were successfully established for 179 cases. HPV- tumours showed an increased frequency of alterations in tumour suppressor genes compared to HPV+ cases (TP53 67% versus 4%, CDKN2A 18% versus 0%). Conversely, HPV+ carcinomas were enriched for activating mutations in driver genes compared to HPV- cases (PIK3CA 30% versus 12%, KRAS 6% versus 1%, and NRAS 4% versus 0%). Hotspot TP53 missense mutations in HPV- carcinomas correlated with an increased risk of locoregional recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-12.1, P=0.006) and death (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-4.4, P=0.021). In HPV+ SCCHN, driver gene mutations were associated per trend with a higher risk of death (HR 3.9, 95% CI 0.7-21.1, P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Distinct mutation profiles in HPV- and HPV+ SCCHN identify subgroups with poor outcome after adjuvant chemoradiation. Mutant p53 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway were identified as potential druggable targets for subgroup-specific treatment optimisation.

All selected patients received preoperative external beam radiation to the pelvis because of endorectal ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging evidence of T3-4 and/or N1 disease. External beam radiation consisted of 30 Gy delivered over 10 fractions. Patients underwent TME (total mesorectal excision) 2-4 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: The CD133 antigen has been identified as a putative stem cell marker in colorectal cancer tissues. According to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, CD133+ cells determine long-term tumour growth and are therefore suspected of influencing clinical outcome. The aim was to investigate the prognostic value of CD133 expression in rectal cancer patients after preoperative radiation and curative resection. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of the CD133 stem cell antigen in a series of 73 patients with rectal cancer of various ypTNM stages was analysed by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. The prognostic value of CD133 expression and other clinicopathological factors was evaluated. On multivariate survival analysis, the proportion of CD133+ cells was a significant (P < 0.05) prognostic factor for adverse disease-free survival and overall survival independent of ypTNM stage, tumour differentiation or lymphovascular invasion. CONCLUSIONS: CD133 stem cell antigen expression correlates with patient survival in rectal cancer, lending support to the current cancer stem cell hypothesis.

Seventy-six patients were randomized to preoperative radiotherapy, receiving 25 Gy in ﬁve fractions over a median of 6 days (range 5-12). Surgery was then performed after a median of 3 days (range 1-13) after the radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND:\nRectal carcinoma is a common malignancy, with a history of high local recurrence rates following surgery. In recent years. preoperative radiotherapy and refined surgical technique have improved local control rates.\n\nAIM: To investigate the relationship between expression of nuclear p53 protein and the outcome in rectal carcinoma, with and without short-term preoperative radiotherapy. MATERIAL: Specimens from 163 patients from the Southeast Swedish Health Care region included in the Swedish rectal cancer trial between 1987-1990. METHOD: New sections from the paraffin blocks of the preoperative biopsy and the surgical specimen were examined immunohistochemically using a p53 antibody (PAb 1801). RESULT: Expression of nuclear p53 protein was seen in 41% of the tumours. The p53 negative patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy had a significant reduction of local failure compared with the non-irradiated p53 negative patients (P = 0.0008). In contrast, p53 positive patients showed no benefit from preoperative radiotherapy. The interaction between p53 status and the benefit of radiotherapy was statistically significant (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Expression of nuclear p53 protein in rectal carcinoma seems to be a significant predictive factor for local treatment failure after preoperative radiotherapy. Further investigations are necessary to select patients for preoperative treatment based on analysis of the preoperative biopsies.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	\N

Standardized surgery was scheduled 5 weeks after completion of pre-operative treatment and clinical re-staging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Pre-operative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer (UICC-II/III) may significantly reduce local tumour mass. Response to pre-operative treatment, however, varies significantly. Thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) are thought to be important predictors for the efficiency of 5-FU-based treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between TS-, TP-, and DPD-gene expression and the response to 5-FU-based long-term pre-operative chemoradiotherapy assessed by histopathological tumour regression. Additionally, the predictive value of intra-tumoural TS-, TP-, and DPD-gene expression in pre-operative rectal tumour biopsies was assessed by correlation with the histopathological regression grade. Formalin-fixed, paraffin wax-embedded pre-operative biopsies (n = 14) and surgical resection specimens (n = 40) from patients with rectal carcinoma (clinical UICC stage II/III) receiving neo-adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy were studied for TS-, TP-, and DPD-gene expression by quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR after laser microdissection. Results were compared with standardized histopathological tumour regression analysis. There was a significant association between low TS-gene expression in pre-operative tumour biopsies and tumour response (p = 0.02). TS- and TP-gene expression was significantly lower in resection specimens of responders than of non-responders (p = 0.02) when microdissection was used. Statistical significance was even higher when TS and TP were combined (p = 0.0001). For the DPD gene, no significance was found at all. In conclusion, this study shows that TS gene expression in a pretreatment biopsy predicts the response of local rectal cancer to neo-adjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy in a high percentage. Moreover, intra-tumoural TS- and TP-gene expression in surgical rectal specimens after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy correlates significantly with histopathological tumour regression when microdissection is applied.

Staining intensity with 0 and 1 was deﬁned as low intensity, 2 and 3 as high intensity. The highest intensity in any given tumor was scored. The pattern score (method B) ranged from 0 to 4: 0 = no staining, 1 = 0% to 10% of the tumor cells, 2 = 10% to 25% of the tumor cells, 3 = 25% to 50% of the tumor cells, 4 = 50% to 100% of the tumor cells. Staining of 25% or fewer stained tumor cells was deﬁned as focal, staining of more than 25% tumor cells as diffuse. A third scoring system (method C) was used including both intensity and pattern score: each intensity grade was multiplied with its corresponding percentage of tumor cells and these scores were ﬁnally added (eg, tumor with weak staining intensity in 80% of the tumor cells and a very strong staining intensity in 20%: 1 x 4 + 3 x 2 = 10).	For all patients a curative (R0) tumor resection was aimed for after a standardized preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemoradiotherapy. Standardized surgery was scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after completion of preoperative treatment and clinical restaging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	In locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based long-term chemoradiotherapy leads to marked tumor reduction and decrease of local recurrence rate. Thymidylate synthase (TS), thymidine phosphorylase (TP), and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) are known to be important biomarkers to predict tumor response to 5-FU-based therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between TS, TP, and DPD protein expression and histopathologic tumor regression after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The results were compared with the recently published mRNA data. Preoperative biopsies (n = 25) and resection specimens (n = 40) from patients with rectal carcinoma (clinical UICC stage II/III) receiving neoadjuvant 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy were studied for TS, TP, and DPD protein expression by immunohistochemistry using three different scoring systems (intensity, pattern, intensity + pattern). Results were compared with histopathologic tumor regression. A significant correlation between protein expression and tumor response was only seen when both staining intensity and staining pattern were considered. With this method, a significant association was seen between high TS expression in tumor biopsies as well as resection specimens and nonresponse of the tumor to therapy (P = 0.04). Furthermore, low TP expression in the resection specimens was significantly associated with lack of response (P = 0.02). For DPD no significant correlations were found at all. In conclusion, these results suggest that immunohistochemistry like RT-PCR is a suitable method to determine the correlation between TS, TP, and DPD expression and histopathologic tumor regression. However, precise results can only be achieved if staining intensity as well as staining pattern within the tumors are evaluated.

Treatment was completed by postoperative application of 4 cycles of bolus 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/㎡/d, 5 times weekly, repeated every 4 wk).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Histologic tumor regression (TR) in rectal cancer after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CT/RT) may be useful as a surrogate end point for early treatment efficacy, but little is known about its prognostic value. The aim of this follow-up study was to evaluate whether TR is able to predict prognosis in rectal cancer patients. Furthermore, the prognostic value of thymidylate synthase (TS)-gene, thymidine phosphorylase (TP)-gene, and dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)-gene expression after neoadjuvant CT/RT was determined. Forty patients with rectal cancer cUICC stage II/III, receiving preoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based CT/RT were studied for therapy-induced TR and categorized as "responders" or "nonresponders" according to their TR-grade. Posttherapeutical TS-gene, TP-gene, and DPD-gene expression on surgical resection specimens was quantified by TaqMan real-time PCR after microdissection. During a median follow-up of 58 months, cancer recurrence occurred in 28%. A significant correlation was seen between disease-free survival and lymph node status (P<0.001). All patients, who developed cancer recurrence had a posttherapeutical positive lymph node status. The majority of patients with cancer recurrence were "responders" (91%) after CT/RT. There was a significant correlation between posttherapeutical TS-gene expression and cancer recurrence within the subgroup of "responders." TS-gene expression was significantly higher in patients with cancer recurrence than in those, who are disease-free up to date (P=0.028). In conclusion, lymph node status remains the most important prognostic marker in rectal cancer patients, whereas posttreatment TR by itself has no prognostic significance. Furthermore, measurement of posttherapeutical TS-gene expression may help to identify patients at higher risk for cancer recurrence.	The American Journal of Surgical Pathology	\N

Responders (ie, those with 50% response at the primary site) received CRT (chemoradiotherapy); nonresponders received surgery and radiation. Adjuvant paclitaxel was offered after CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To prospectively identify markers of response to therapy and outcome in an organ-sparing trial for advanced oropharyngeal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment biopsies were examined for expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p16, Bcl-xL, and p53 as well as for p53 mutation. These markers were assessed for association with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), response to therapy, and survival. Patient variables included smoking history, sex, age, primary site, tumor stage, and nodal status. RESULTS: EGFR expression was inversely associated with response to induction chemotherapy (IC) (P = .01), chemotherapy/radiotherapy (CRT; P = .055), overall survival (OS; P = .001), and disease-specific survival (DSS; P = .002) and was directly associated with current smoking (P = .04), female sex (P = .053), and lower HPV titer (P = .03). HPV titer was significantly associated with p16 expression (P < .0001); p16 was significantly associated with response to IC (P = .008), CRT (P = .009), OS (P = .001), and DSS (P = .003). As combined markers, lower HPV titer and high EGFR expression were associated with worse OS (rho(EGFR) = 0.008; rho(HPV) = 0.03) and DSS (rho(EGFR) = 0.01; rho(HPV) = 0.016). In 36 of 42 biopsies, p53 was wild-type, and only one HPV-positive tumor had mutant p53. The combination of low p53 and high Bcl-xL expression was associated with poor OS (P = .005) and DSS (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Low EGFR and high p16 (or higher HPV titer) expression are markers of good response to organ-sparing therapy and outcome, whereas high EGFR expression, combined low p53/high Bcl-xL expression, female sex, and smoking are associated with a poor outcome. Smoking cessation and strategies to target EGFR and Bcl-xL are important adjuncts to the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer.

203	Effect of HPV-associated p16INK4A expression on response to radiotherapy and survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	English	2009	19289615	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19289615	Journal Article	\N	156	115	41	60	\N	[24.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors were classiﬁed dichotomously as either CDKN2A-positive (strong, diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in > 10% of carcinoma cells) or negative.	Patients in this arm received primary conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (66 to 68 Gy in 33 to 34 fractions, 5 fractions/wk) as the only treatment.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: A subset of head and neck cancers is associated with the human papillomavirus (HPV). Viral infection is closely correlated with expression of p16(INK4A) in these tumors. We evaluated p16(INK4A) as a prognostic marker of treatment response and survival in a well-defined and prospectively collected cohort of patients treated solely with conventional radiotherapy in the Danish Head and Neck Cancer Group (DAHANCA) 5 trial.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical expression of p16(INK4A) was analyzed in pretreatment paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from 156 patients treated with conventional primary radiotherapy alone. The influence of p16(INK4A) status on locoregional tumor control, disease-specific survival, and overall survival after radiotherapy was evaluated. RESULTS: p16(INK4A) positivity was found in 35 tumors (22%). Tumor-positivity for p16(INK4A) was significantly correlated with improved locoregional tumor control (5-year actuarial values 58% v 28%; P = .0005), improved disease-specific survival (72% v 34%; P = .0006), and improved overall survival (62% v 26%; P = .0003). In multivariate analysis, p16(INK4A) remained a strong independent prognostic factor for locoregional failure (hazard ratio [HR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.64), disease-specific death (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.64), and overall death (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.68). CONCLUSION: Expression of p16(INK4A) has a major impact on treatment response and survival in patients with head and neck cancer treated with conventional radiotherapy.

204	Nuclear expression of human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (HAP1/Ref-1) in head-and-neck cancer is associated with resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor outcome	English	2001	11316543	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11316543	Journal Article	\N	95	87	8	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Mean	Thirty-eight patients received 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy followed by radical radiotherapy (LINAC 6 MV or Cobalt 60 unit, 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week; total tumor dose 70 Gy). Fifty-seven patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (same radiotherapy regimen). None of the patients underwent surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: HAP1/Ref-1 endonuclease is involved in the repair of DNA strand breaks and in the activation of DNA binding of several transcription factors. HAP1 is also a potent activator of wild type p53. It therefore has multiple possible roles in the response of human cancer to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The nuclear expression of HAP1 and p53 proteins was studied by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded material from 95 patients with locally advanced squamous cell head-and-neck cancer (HNC) treated with radical radiotherapy (38 cases with induction platinum-based chemotherapy and 57 with concurrent platinum chemoradiotherapy). RESULTS: HAP1 was present in the nuclei of normal epithelium and stromal cells. Loss of HAP1 nuclear expression was frequently noted in cancer cells. Tumors with high HAP1 nuclear expression (% of positive cells > mean; mean = 11%) were of good differentiation (p = 0.06) and presented frequently with advanced nodal disease (p = 0.01). High nuclear HAP1 expression was significantly associated with poor complete response rate (p = 0.00001), shorter local relapse-free interval (p < 0.0001), and poorer survival (p < 0.0008). HAP1 nuclear reactivity was inversely associated with p53 nuclear accumulation (p = 0.003). The inverse correlation between HAP1 expression and prognosis was independent of p53 status. CONCLUSION: HAP1 nuclear expression in HNC is inversely associated with p53 nuclear accumulation and directly related to resistance to chemoradiotherapy and poor survival. Further clinical investigation is required to confirm these findings.

205	Deficiency in expression and epigenetic DNA Methylation of ASS1 gene in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: negative prognostic impact and therapeutic relevance	English	2014	23897555	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23897555	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The cutoff value of <5 % cytoplasmic reactivity to define aberrant ASS1 loss were as previously reported.	Of all 124 patients with NPC, 114 patients were regularly monitored after radiotherapy until death or their last appointment with the mean follow-up duration being 67.0 months (range, 3-141). Based on the published protocol, patients with stage II-IV diseases also received cisplatin-based chemotherapy in addition to a complete course of radiotherapy (total dose ≧7,000 cGy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The risk stratification and final outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) still remain suboptimal. Our principal goals were to identify and validate targetable metabolic drivers relevant to pathogenesis of NPC using a published transcriptome. One prominently downregulated gene regulating amino acid metabolism was found to be argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS1). Attributable to epigenetic DNA methylation, ASS1 deficiency may link to the therapeutic sensitivity to the arginine-depriving agents and promote tumor aggressiveness through its newly identified tumor suppressor function. ASS1 immunohistochemistry was therefore examined in a well-defined cohort of 124 NPC biopsy specimens and in the neck lymph node metastases of another ten independent cases. For the latter, bisulphite pyrosequencing was performed to evaluate the extent of ASS1 gene methylation. ASS1 protein deficiency was identified in 64 of 124 cases (51.6%), significantly related to T3-T4 status (p = 0.006), and univariately associated with inferior local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0427), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS; p = 0.0036), and disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.0069). Together with advanced AJCC stages III-IV, ASS1 protein deficiency was also independently predictive of worse outcomes for the DFMS (p = 0.010, hazard ratio = 2.241) and DSS (p = 0.020, hazard ratio = 1.900). ASS1 promoter hypermethylation was detected in eight of ten neck nodal metastatic lesions by bisulphite pyrosequencing and associated with ASS1 protein deficiency (p < 0.001). In summary, ASS1 protein deficiency was seen in approximately a half of NPCs and associated with advanced T classification, DNA methylation, and clinical aggressiveness, consistent with its tumor suppressor role. This aberration may render pegylated arginine deiminase as a promising strategy for ASS1-deficient NPCs.	Tumor Biology	Stage I-II: 38 patients, Stage III-IV: 86 patients.
217	Impact of Expression of CD44, a Cancer Stem Cell Marker, on the Treatment Outcomes of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in Patients With Oropharyngeal Squamous CellCarcinoma	English	2016	26867875	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26867875	Journal Article	\N	58	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	As previously described, a tumor was regarded as positive for CDKN2A expression when strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining of 70% or more of the tumor cells was observed Even though there is no consensus regarding the optimum cutoff threshold of positivity of CD44 expression, a tumor was regarded as positive for CD44 expression in the present study when strong and diffuse membranous staining of 70% or more of the tumor cells was observed.	Intensity modulated radiation therapy was undertaken by the simultaneously integrated boost technique; prescribed doses for the high-, intermediate-, and low-risk targets were 70 Gy, 60 Gy, and 54 Gy, respectively, all administered in 33 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered to patients who were aged 75 years with stage III or IVA/B disease. Induction chemotherapy was administered to patients with N2c disease or supraclavicular lymph node involvement.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To investigate the significance of CD44 protein expression on the treatment outcomes of radiation therapy in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) with or without p16 protein expression in the tumor tissue. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We reviewed the medical records of 58 OPSCC patients who had undergone radiation therapy and examined the tumor tissue expressions of CD44 and p16 protein by immunohistochemical staining. The correlations between the expressions of these proteins and the patients' treatment outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: The data of 58 consecutive OPSCC patients who had undergone definitive intensity modulated radiation therapy were analyzed. The male/female ratio was 55:3, and the median age was 64 years. The clinical stage of the disease was stage II in 7 patients, stage III in 5 patients, stage IVA in 35 patients, and stage IVB in 11 patients. Of the patients, 79% received additional induction and/or concurrent chemotherapy. The median follow-up duration was 34 months. The 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and locoregional control (LRC) rates of all the patients, regardless of the results of immunohistochemistry, were 73%, 64% and 76%, respectively. The PFS and LRC rates in the CD44(-) patients (86% and 93%, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the CD44(+) patients (57% and 70%, respectively). The PFS and LRC rates in the p16(+) patients (83% and 90%, respectively) were significantly higher than those in the p16(-) patients (45% and 61%, respectively). Patients who were CD44(-)/p16(+) showed the best LRC rates, and those who were CD44(+)/p16(-) showed the worst PFS and LRC rates among all the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Profiling of CD44 and p16 protein expressions by immunohistochemical staining is useful for predicting the treatment outcomes in patients with OPSCC undergoing definitive intensity modulated radiation therapy.

206	SKP2 overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis of rectal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy and represents a therapeutic target with high potential	English	2013	23328995	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23328995	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Preoperatively, radiotherapy with a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions was given over a period of 5 weeks with a concurrent 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) oncoprotein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Overexpression of SKP2 was found in various human cancers, including colorectal cancers, but its potential role as a prognostic marker after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and for therapeutic intervention in rectal cancers is unknown. This study examined the correlation of SKP2 expression in the prognosis of rectal cancer patients and the viability of colorectal cancer cells treated with CRT. SKP2 immunoexpression was retrospectively assessed in pretreatment biopsies of 172 rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery. Results were correlated with clinicopathological features, therapeutic responses, and patient survival. Pharmacologic assays were used to evaluate the therapeutic relevance of Bortezomib in two colorectal cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW480). High expression of SKP2 was correlated with the advanced Post-Tx nodal status (p = 0.002), Post-Tx International Union for Cancer Control stage (p = 0.002), and a lower-degree tumor regression grade (p < 0.001). Moreover, high expression of SKP2 (p = 0.027, hazard ratio 3.21) was an independent prognostic factor for local recurrence-free survival. In vitro, Bortezomib downregulated SKP2 expression, induced caspase activation, and decreased the viability of colorectal cancer cells with or without a combination with fluorouracil. Bortezomib also promoted caspase activation and gamma-H2AX formation in colorectal cancer cells concurrently treated with CRT. High expression of SKP2 was associated with a poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT. In the presence of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy, the promoted sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to Bortezomib with an SKP2-repressing effect indicated that it is a potential therapeutic target.

207	bcl-2 protein expression correlates with recurrence and survival in early stage head and neck cancer treated by radiotherapy	English	1996	9816168	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9816168	Journal Article	\N	71	67	4	62	63.5	[42.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	BCL2 expression was categorized as follows: negative (-), if no staining was seen in tumor cells or if only a weak positive and heterogeneous staining was observed in <30% of the tumor cells, or positive (+), if staining was observed in >30% of the cells according to others.	All patients were irradiated with 60 Co or a 4/5 MeV linear accelerator. The daily dose ranged from 1.8 to 2.0 Gy. Patients received doses in the range of >52-70 Gy (mean, 63.8 Gy) to the primary and 50-58 (mean, 54.2) to the neck.	Radiotherapy	5	Preoperative chemotherapy and radiation (chemoradiation) are increasingly used in the treatment of advanced rectal carcinoma to downstage the tumor so that a sphincter sparing procedure is used. This treatment modality has also resulted in not only local disease control but also decreased metastasis and increased survival. It is well known that with standard chemoradiation some tumors show marked pathologic response, while others remain non-responsive. Identification of tumor markers that can predict responsiveness to chemoradiation is extremely useful to avoid unnecessary preoperative treatment. To understand the role of thymidylate synthase (TS), p53 and Bcl-2 proteins, if any, in tumor response/resistance to chemoradiation, we examined pretreatment biopsy material obtained from 12 responsive and 13 non-responsive patients by immunohistochemistry. TS was undetectable in 11 of 12 (92%) responsive tumors and overexpressed in only 1 tumor (8%); whereas, p53 or Bcl-2 was overexpressed in 8 tumors (66%). In the non-responsive group of 13 tumors, overexpression of TS, p53 and Bcl-2 was observed in 7, 5 and 6 tumors, respectively. In 6 non-responsive tumors in which TS was undetectable, 5 tumors contained high levels of p53 or Bcl-2. These results indicate that level of TS in tumors is the best predictor of sensitivity or resistance to chemoradiation. No such correlation between overexpression of p53 and Bcl-2 and response to chemoradiation is observed.	Clinical Cancer Research	T1: 56 patients, T2: 15 patients.
208	The Bcl-2 protein: a prognostic indicator strongly related to p53 protein in lymph node-negative breast cancer patients	English	1994	8133533	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8133533	Journal Article	\N	283	\N	283	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For TP53, the value of 5% positive cells was used as a cutoff to define TP53-negative or TP53-positive.	All patients had radical or conservative surgery plus radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The bcl-2 gene (also known as BCL2) encodes for a mitochondrial protein thought to prevent apoptosis of normal cells. The protein has been detected by immunohistochemical procedures in hormonally regulated epithelia. PURPOSE: We analyzed the predictive relevance of Bcl-2 expression on 6-year relapse-free and overall survival in lymph node-negative breast cancers in relation to pathologic (tumor size) and biologic ([3H]thymidine-labeling index, p53 protein expression, and estrogen receptor [ER] status) features. METHODS: The expression of Bcl-2 and p53 was detected by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded sections from 283 node-negative resectable breast cancers treated with local-regional therapy alone until relapse. The [3H]thymidine-labeling index was evaluated on histologic sections after incubation of fresh tumor tissue with [3H]thymidine, and ER content was determined by the dextran-coated charcoal absorption technique. RESULTS: A significantly higher fraction of Bcl-2-positive cells was observed in small, ER-positive, slowly proliferating, and p53-negative tumors than in large, ER-negative, rapidly proliferating, and p53-positive tumors. A stronger association was observed between Bcl-2 and p53 expression than between these variables and [3H]thymidine-labeling index. In univariate analysis, Bcl-2 and p53 expression, [3H]thymidine-labeling index, tumor size, and ER status were indicators for relapse-free and, with the exception of tumor size, overall survival within 6 years of surgery. In multivariate analysis, Bcl-2 failed to maintain its prognostic role for relapse-free and overall survival in the presence of p53 expression, whereas the [3H]thymidine-labeling index was still statistically significant as a predictor for both events.

209	Glioma-associated oncogene family zinc finger 1 expression and metastasis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with radiation therapy (RTOG 9003)	English	2011	19706168	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19706168	Journal Article	\N	1068	851	217	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Brieﬂy, RTOG 9003 was a phase III trial that compared hyperfractionation, split-course accelerated fractionation, and accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost with standard fractionation radiotherapy in American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage III and IV but M0 HNSCC.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The transcription factor GLI1, a member of the GLI subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc finger proteins is involved in signal transduction within the hedgehog pathway. Aberrant hedgehog signalling has been implicated in the development of different human tumour entities such as colon and lung cancer and increased GLI1 expression has been found in these tumour entities as well. In this study we questioned whether GLI1 expression might also be important in human breast cancer development. Furthermore we correlated GLI1 expression with histopathological and clinical data to evaluate whether GLI1 could represent a new prognostic marker in breast cancer treatment. METHODS: Applying semiquantitative realtime PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) GLI1 expression was analysed in human invasive breast carcinomas (n = 229) in comparison to normal human breast tissues (n = 58). GLI1 mRNA expression was furthermore analysed in a set of normal (n = 3) and tumourous breast cell lines (n = 8). IHC data were statistically interpreted using SPSS version 14.0. RESULTS: Initial analysis of GLI1 mRNA expression in a small cohort of (n = 5) human matched normal and tumourous breast tissues showed first tendency towards GLI1 overexpression in human breast cancers. However only a small sample number was included into these analyses and values for GLI1 overexpression were statistically not significant (P = 0.251, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test). On protein level, nuclear GLI1 expression in breast cancer cells was clearly more abundant than in normal breast epithelial cells (P = 0.008, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test) and increased expression of GLI1 protein in breast tumours significantly correlated with unfavourable overall survival (P = 0.019), but also with higher tumour stage (P < 0.001) and an increased number of tumour-positive axillar lymph nodes (P = 0.027). Interestingly, a highly significant correlation was found between GLI1 expression and the expression of SHH, a central upstream molecule of the hedgehog pathway that was previously analysed on the same tissue microarray. CONCLUSION: Our study presents a systematic expression analysis of GLI1 in human breast cancer. Elevated levels of GLI1 protein in human breast cancer are associated with unfavourable prognosis and progressive stages of disease. Thus GLI1 protein expression measured e.g. by an IHC based scoring system might have an implication in future multi-marker panels for human breast cancer prognosis or molecular sub typing. The highly significant correlation between SHH and GLI1 expression characterises GLI1 as a potential functional downstream target of the hedgehog signalling pathway in human breast cancer as well. Furthermore, our study indicates that altered hedgehog signalling may represent a key disease pathway in the progression of human breast cancer.

From December 1999 to October 2008 (45 patients), normofractionated (2 Gy/day, 5 times/week) three-dimensional (3D) conformal external-beam RT was given, the total dose being 70 Gy in each case. From November 2008 to November 2011 (50 patients), an integrated intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with single fractions of 2.2 Gy to the primary tumour and involved lymph nodes up to 66 Gy and single fractions of 1.8 Gy to the drainage sites on both sides of the neck up to 54 Gy was applied daily 5 times per week. Overall, 170 patients (73 %) were treated with concomitant chemotherapy consisting of continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil [600 mg/㎡/total body surface area (BSA)/ day on days 1-5 of radiotherapy] and mitomycin C (10 mg/㎡/TBSA intravenously on days 5 and 36 of radiotherapy) for 94 patients. A total of 76 patients received concomitant intravenous cisplatin 6 mg/㎡/TBSA on every radiotherapy day. Sixty-four patients refused concomitant treatment, or chemotherapy was contraindicated due to reduced general condition or inadequate renal function.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Superior treatment response and survival for patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive head and neck cancer (HNSCC) are documented in clinical studies. However, the relevance of high-grade acute organ toxicity (HGAOT), which has also been correlated with improved prognosis, has attracted scant attention in HPV-positive HNSCC patients. Hence we tested the hypothesis that both parameters, HPV and HGAOT, are positive prognostic factors in patients with HNSCC treated with definite radiotherapy (RT) or radiochemotherapy (RCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment tumor tissue and clinical records were available from 233 patients receiving definite RT (62 patients) or RCT (171 patients). HPV infection was analysed by means of HPV DNA detection or p16(INK4A) expression; HGAOT was defined as the occurrence of acute organ toxicity >grade 2 according to the Common Toxicity Criteria. Both variables were correlated with overall survival (OS) using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Positivity for HPV DNA (44 samples, 18.9 %) and p16(INK4A) expression (102 samples, 43.8 %) were significantly correlated (p < 0.01), and HGAOT occurred in 77 (33 %) patients. Overall, the 5-year OS was 23 %; stratified for p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, OS rates were 47 %, 42 %, 20 % and 10 % for patients with p16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT, patients with HGAOT only, patients with p16(INK4A) expression only, and patients without p16(INK4A) expression or HGAOT, respectively. After multivariate testing p16(INK4A) expression (p = 0.003) and HGAOT (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with OS. CONCLUSION: P16(INK4A) expression and HGAOT are independent prognostic factors for OS of patients with HNSCC, whereas p16(INK4A) expression is particularly important for patients without HGAOT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium, the impact of HPV DNA, p16 overexpression and p53 expression on outcome were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was loco-regional tumour control; secondary endpoints were distant metastases and overall survival. RESULTS: In the total patient population, univariate analyses revealed a significant impact of HPV16 DNA positivity, p16 overexpression, p53 positivity and tumour site on loco-regional tumour control. Multivariate analysis stratified for tumour site showed that positive HPV 16 DNA status correlated with loco-regional tumour control in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (p=0.02) but not in the oral cavity carcinoma group. Multivariate evaluation of the secondary endpoints in the total population revealed a significant association of HPV16 DNA positivity with overall survival (p<0.01) but not with distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: HPV16 DNA status appears to be a strong prognosticator of loco-regional tumour control after postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy of locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma and is now being explored in a prospective validation trial.

213	Independent validation of the prognostic value of cancer stem cellmarker expression and hypoxia-induced gene expression for patientswith locally advanced HNSCC after postoperative radiotherapy	English	2016	\N	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405630816300064	Journal Article	\N	373	307	66	\N	\N	[24.0,75.2)	Immunohistochemistry	Overexpression of CDKN2A was deﬁned as ≥70% intense tumour staining. CD44 staining intensity was scored (0, +, ++, +++) and tumours with a minimum of 10% staining were considered as positive.	Treatment between 1999 and 2006 with PORT or PORT-C in curative intention according to standard radiotherapy protocols (2 Gy/fraction, 5 fractions/week), covering the former tumour region and regional lymph nodes (50 Gy) and a boost (10-16 Gy) to the former tumour region and to the regions of involved lymph nodes. Before surgery, all patients had undergone staging (computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound), and only patients without evidence of distant metastases were included.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Objective: To validate the impact of HPV status, cancer stem cell (CSC) marker expression and tumour hypoxia status in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), who received postoperative radiotherapy. The results of the exploration cohort have previously been reported by the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG; Lohaus et al., 2014; Linge et al., 2016). Materials and methods: For 152 patients with locally advanced HNSCC the impact of HPV16 DNA status, CSC marker expression and hypoxia-associated gene signatures on outcome of postoperative radiotherapy were retrospectively analysed. Out of them, 40 patients received postoperative radiochemotherapy. Cox models presented in a previous study were validated using the concordance index as a performance measure. The primary endpoint of this study was loco-regional control. Results were compared to those previously reported by DKTK-ROG. Results: Loco-regional control, freedom from distant metastases and overall survival were inferior to the previously reported cohort. Despite of this, the prognostic value of the combination of HPV infection status, CSC marker expression (SLC3A2) and tumour hypoxia status could be validated in univariate analyses using an independent validation cohort. For multivariate models, the concordance index was between 0.58 and 0.69 in validation, indicating a good prognostic performance of the models. The inclusion of CD44 and the 15-gene hypoxia signature moderately improved the performance compared to a baseline model without CSC markers or hypoxia classifiers. Conclusions: The HPV status, CSC marker expression of CD44 and SLC3A2 as well as hypoxia status are potential prognostic biomarkers for patients with locally advanced HNSCC treated by postoperative radiotherapy.

214	CD44 expression predicts local recurrence after radiotherapy in larynx cancer	English	2010	20837694	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837694	Journal Article	\N	52	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Both series comprised early stage cancer treated with radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To find molecular markers from expression profiling data to predict recurrence of laryngeal cancer after radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We generated gene expression data on pre-treatment biopsies from 52 larynx cancer patients. Patients developing a local recurrence were matched for T-stage, subsite, treatment, gender and age with non-recurrence patients. Candidate genes were then tested by immunohistochemistry on tumor material from a second series of 76 patients. Both series comprised early stage cancer treated with radiotherapy alone. Finally, gene expression data of eight larynx cancer cell lines with known radiosensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Nineteen patients with a local recurrence were matched with 33 controls. Gene sets for hypoxia, proliferation and intrinsic radiosensitivity did not correlate with recurrence, whereas expression of the putative stem cell marker CD44 did. In a supervised analysis, probes for all three splice variants of CD44 on the array appeared in the top 10 most significantly correlated with local recurrence. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD44 expression on the independent validation series confirmed CD44's predictive potential. In 8 larynx cancer cell lines, CD44 gene expression did not correlate with intrinsic radiosensitivity although it did correlate significantly with plating efficiency, consistent with a relationship with stem cell content. CONCLUSIONS: CD44 was the only biological factor tested which significantly correlated with response to radiotherapy in early stage larynx cancer patients, both at the mRNA and protein levels. Further studies are needed to confirm this and to assess how general these findings are for other head and neck tumor stages and sites.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N
215	Expression of Ku80 in cervical cancer correlates with response to radiotherapy and survival	English	2003	12902903	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12902903	Journal Article	\N	89	\N	89	\N	65.5999999999999943	[32.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	At first, on the basis of the percentages of XRCC5 immunopositive cells in the tumors, the lesions were scored as follows: score 0 if no or fewer than 10% positive cells; score 1+ if more than 10% but fewer than 50% positive cells; or score 2+ if more than 50% positive cells in the tumor cells. Second, because it is possible that density of staining suggests more cellular turnover rather than less expression, on the basis of the density of XRCC5-immunopositive cells in the tumors, the lesions were scored as follows: score 0 if no or very weak density of positive cells; score 1+ if moderate density of positive cells; or score 2+ if strong density of positive cells in the tumor cells. The final lesion score was the sum of the percentage score and the density score. The tumors were defined as XRCC5-negative when the score was 0, 1+, or 2+, and XRCC5-positive when the score was 3+ or 4+.	All patients entered in the identical protocol were treated with external pelvic radiation therapy using 6-mV high-energy linear accelerators. A total of 30.6 Gy was administered to the whole pelvis. An additional dose was given to the parametria with central shielding to complete 52.2 Gy; and patients also received 192 Ir high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Radiation was delivered to the tumor in fractions of 1.8 Gy per day 5 days per week. The dose of 192 Ir brachytherapy for all patients was 30 Gy to point A (2 cm lateral to the central canal of the uterus and 2 cm up from the mucous membrane of the lateral fornix in the axis of the uterus) given at 7.5 Gy per session once a week.	Radiotherapy	5	To reveal the genes relevant for prediction of cervical cancer after radiotherapy, we previously carried out cDNA microarray experiments on primary cervical cancer comparing patients with a complete response (CR) and those with no change (NC). Some of these genes had already been associated with the radiation response, such as x-ray repair cross-complementing 5 (XRCC5), which was found more in radioresistant tumors than in radiosensitive ones. The aim of this study was to confirm the possible roles of XRCC5 mRNA levels by a real-time polymerase chain reaction method in 20 cervical cancers, and Ku80 protein, which is the gene product of XRCC5, using a histopathologic method of formalin-fixed sections of tumor biopsies in determining tumor response to radiotherapy and survival in 89 patients with cervical cancer. The levels of XRCC5 mRNA were 10(4.82) +/- 10(0.2) copies/microg total RNA in tumor tissues in the CR group (mean +/- standard deviation) and 10(4.95) +/- 10(0.32) copies/microg total RNA in those in the NC group. The levels of XRCC5 mRNA were not significantly different between the CR and NC groups. Histopathologic methods revealed 29.2% (26 of 89) of the patients to be Ku80-negative, with Ku80-positive findings in 70.8% (63 of 89). Of the Ku80-negative patients, 19 had CR, 3 had a partial response (PR), and 4 had NC. Of the Ku80-positive patients, 25 had CR, 22 had PR, and 16 had NC. Ku80-negative tumors showed significantly better responses than Ku80-positive ones, comparing CR and PR/NC responses (p = 0.01). In addition, overall survival was significantly better in the Ku80-negative patients as compared with those who were Ku80-positive (p = 0.04). The results of this study suggest that a low expression of Ku80 protein leads to radiosensitivity in cervical cancer and that Ku80 might play a role in treatment outcome.

216	Gene expression classifier predicts for hypoxic modification of radiotherapy with nimorazole in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck	English	2012	21996521	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21996521	Journal Article	\N	323	231	92	60	\N	[24.0,84.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	In the DAHANCA 5 study (January 1986 to September 1990), patients with advanced cancer of the supraglottic larynx or pharynx treated with conventional radiotherapy (62-68 Gy in 33-34 fx, 5 fx/wk) were randomized to placebo or the hypoxic sensitizer nimorazole.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To validate the predictive impact of a hypoxia gene expression classifier in identifying patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) having benefit from hypoxic modification of radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expressions were quantified from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies of 323 HNSCC patients randomized for placebo or nimorazole in conjunction with radiotherapy in the DAHANCA 5 study. Tumours were classified as either "more" or "less" hypoxic with a classifier constituting of 15 hypoxia responsive genes. The predictive impact was evaluated by analysing the response to nimorazole vs. placebo in terms of loco-regional tumour control (LRC) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in the two classified groups. RESULTS: Hundred and fourteen patients (35%) were classified as having "more" hypoxic tumours. These patients had a significant benefit of hypoxic modification with nimorazole compared with placebo in terms of LRC (5-year actuarial values 49% vs. 18%; p=0.001) and DSS (48% vs. 30%; p=0.04). "Less" hypoxic tumours had no significant effect of hypoxic modification (LRC: 50% vs. 44%; p=0.39, DSS: 57% vs. 51%; p=0.49) and generally an outcome, which was similar to "more" hypoxic tumours treated with nimorazole. In contrast to HPV-negative tumours, HPV-positive tumours had a substantially better outcome in response to radiotherapy, which was irrespective of hypoxic modification. CONCLUSIONS: A predictive 15-gene hypoxia classifier could identify patients associated with improved outcome after combining radiotherapy with hypoxic modification and underlines the relevance of such therapy. The impact of the classifier was limited to HPV-negative tumours.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	Stage I-II: 66 patients, Stage III-IV: 257 patients.
220	Fatty acid synthase overexpression confers an independent prognosticator and associates with radiation resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2013	23208675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23208675	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	48.6000000000000014	[20.0,83.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Cases with H score no less than the median were determined to have FASN high expression, regardless of whether those with H score less than median was low expression.	All of 124 cases with follow-up for outcome received complete course of radiotherapy with the daily fractionation of 180-200 cGy, five fractions weekly to achieve a total dose of no less than 7,000 cGy. As a rule, cisplatin-based chemotherapy of at least three cycles was performed in those with stage II-IV diseases. However, there were one patient with stage II and four with stage IV diseases received radiotherapy alone for the poor general condition. The method of radiotherapy was in general uniform within this period.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is overexpressed in many human cancers and associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of FASN in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been studied. We evaluated the expression of FASN immunohistochemically in 124 NPC specimens, stratified them into two groups (FASN-high and FASN-low), and examined the correlation with various clinicopathological parameters. In two NPC cell lines, HONE1 and TW01, we targeted the FASN transcript by shRNAi and evaluated the effect on cell proliferation by WST-1 assay and radiation-induced apoptosis by measuring caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation. NPC with high FASN immunoexpression was correlated with advanced pT disease status and worse prognosis in terms of disease-specific survival, metastasis-free survival and local recurrence-free survival, compared to FASN-low group in both univariate and multivariate analyses. In the two NPC cell lines, endogenous FASN expression was significantly higher than the non-tumor keratinocyte, DOK. When the expression of FASN was suppressed by shRNAi, the tumor cells showed decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis after radiation. Our results supported FASN as an adverse prognostic marker in NPC, possibly by conferring cell growth advantage and resistance to radiation-induced apoptosis on tumor cells. The inhibition of FASN expression might be investigated as an adjunct in treatment, especially in radiation resistant NPC.	Tumor Biology	Stage I-II: 38 patients, Stage III-IV: 86 patients.
221	Expressions of Ku70 and DNA-PKcs as prognostic indicators of local control in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2005	16029807	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16029807	Journal Article	\N	66	55	11	50	\N	[19.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	When at least 50% of the tumor cells in the biopsy specimen were immunopositive for XRCC6 or for PRKDC, the patient was classiﬁed in the XRCC6 (+) or PRKDC (+) groups, respectively; when less than 50% of tumor cells were immunopositive, the patient was classiﬁed in the corresponding low expression group.	The treatment was administered as 1.8-2.0 Gy daily fractions, 5 days per week, for a total intended dose of 74.4 Gy. All patients received bilateral treatments of 50 Gy to the regional lymph nodes. RT was delivered with a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation by means of a remote afterloading system using 192 Ir sources (Gamma-Med II). External irradiation was performed using a dose of 1.8 Gy to 2.0 Gy per fraction, 5 times per week, to a total dose of 60 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation with 3 insertions (3 times per week) with a fractional dose of 5.0 Gy to a total dose of 15.0 Gy at 1 cm from the mucosal surface. Twenty-ﬁve of 66 patients received external radiotherapy alone using 3D conformal radiation therapy technique to a total dose of 70.2 Gy for the gross tumor volume. Fifty-four of all patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Cisplatin 20 mg/㎡ in 500 mL of normal saline was administered weekly during radiation therapy by i.v. infusion over 1 h. Before cisplatin was administered, prehydration was carried out with a 1-L infusion of isotonic saline. To reduce nausea and vomiting, patients were treated with serotonin antag- onist and dexamethasone intravenously. After completing the treatment, all patients were followed every 3 months for at least 5 years. At 1 month after completion of RT, the RT response was evaluated by clinical examination, CT (MRI) scan, and biopsy, when required.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine whether the expressions of the two components of DNA-dependent protein kinase, Ku70 and DNA-protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), influence the response to radiotherapy (RT) and outcome of treatment of nondisseminated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in patients who received definitive RT. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-six patients with NPC who were treated with radiotherapy alone or with concurrent chemotherapy between June 1995 and December 2001 were divided into groups based on the levels of immunoreactivity for Ku70 and DNA-PKcs in pretreatment biopsy specimens. The overexpression of Ku70 or DNA-PKcs groups included patients whose biopsy specimens showed at least 50% immunopositive tumor cells; patients in which less than 50% of the tumor cells in the biopsy tissues were immunopositive were placed in the low Ku70 and DNA-PKcs groups. The immunoreactivities for Ku70 and DNA-PKcs were retrospectively compared with the sensitivity of the tumor to radiation and the patterns of therapy failure. Univariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors that influenced locoregional control of NPC. RESULTS: The 5-year locoregional control rate was significantly higher in the low Ku70 group (Ku-) (85%) than in the high Ku70 group (Ku+) (42%) (p = 0.0042). However, there were no differences in the metastases-free survival rates between the 2 groups (Ku70+, 82%; Ku70- 78%; p = 0.8672). Univariate analysis indicated that the overexpression of Ku70 surpassed other well-known predictive clinicopathologic parameters as an independent prognostic factor for locoregional control. Eighteen of 22 patients who had locoregional recurrences of the tumor displayed an overexpression of Ku70. No significant association was found between the level of DNA-PKcs expression and the clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the level of Ku70 expression can be used as a molecular marker to predict the response to RT and the locoregional control after RT and concurrent chemotherapy in patients with nondisseminated NPC.

222	DNA-PKcs expression in esophageal cancer as a predictor for chemoradiation therapeuticsensitivity	English	2002	12464596	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12464596	Journal Article	\N	67	60	7	\N	66.5	\N	Immunohistochemistry	A high-expression case was defined as PRKDC immunoreactivity in at least 30%, which was determined according to the mean ratio of 31% of the ratio in cancer cells.	They were treated in our insitute with CRT (chemoradiotherapy) alone (34 patients) or CRT followed by surgery (33 patients). CRT was performed as follows. One cycle consisted of a continuous intravenous drip of 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/day) and cis-platinum (10 rag/day) combined with radiation (2 Gy/day) for 5 days. For irradiation, conventional fractionation (2 Gy per fractionation per day) was used, with a margin of 2 to 3 cm from the tumor edge. Four cycles of this protocol were repeated in 4 weeks. The anticancer drugs were reduced in some older patients or in those with complications.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: It would be of considerable benefit to patients with esophageal cancer to be able to predict the effect of CRT before therapy, because critical side effects could be avoided and the therapeutic cost of CRT-resistant cases could be reduced. One of the biological parameters with the potential to indicate radioresponse is the DNA double-strand break repair enzyme DNA-PKcs. This study aims to clarify the correlation between DNA-PKcs expression and CRT effect. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients with progressive esophageal cancer treated with CRT were included in this study. The relationship between the expression of DNA-PKcs and the effect of CRT was examined by using immunohistochemistry. The relationships between DNA-PKcs expression, clinicopathologic parameters, and CRT effect were investigated statistically. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between the expression of DNA-PKcs and the effect of CRT (P =.0149). The high-DNA-PKcs expression group showed greater therapeutic sensitivity than the low-expression group. Clinicopathologic factors had no relationship with DNA-PKcs expression or CRT effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high expression of DNA-PKcs correlates with CRT effect. DNA-PKcs expression could, therefore, be useful for predicting the effect of CRT. In addition, these results may make it possible to plan therapy taking patients' quality of life into consideration.

Of the 43 patients in the preoperative CRT group, 40 patients had histological cofirmation of adenocarcinoma in pretherapic biopsy specimens. Sphincter saving resection was performed 4-6 weeks after the completion of CRT. All patients with pathological stage III disease received postoperative 5-ﬂuorouracil-based chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	CD133-positive cells have been reported to possess a cancer-initiating-cell phenotype and the property of resistance to chemoradiation therapy in colorectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to evaluate quantitative and locational changes in CD133-positive cells in rectal cancer patients who received preoperative chemoradiation therapy. The prognostic significance of CD133 expression in patients with preoperative chemoradiation therapy was also analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for CD133 and cancer-initiating-cell marker CD44 were performed in 92 surgically resected rectal cancers. Of the 92 cases, 43 patients received preoperative chemoradiation therapy and 49 patients underwent surgery alone. Forty pretherapic biopsy specimens from 43 patients in preoperative chemoradiation therapy group were also analyzed. CD133-positive cases were more common in the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group than in the surgery-alone group (P = 0.03). Further, CD133-positive cases were more common in the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group than in pretherapic biopsy specimens (P = 0.02). In the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group, the CD133-positive cases showed poorer prognosis than the CD133-negative cases. On the other hand, the frequency of CD44-positive case within cancer tissue was similar between the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group and the surgery-alone group. CD44 expression in the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group was not associated with prognosis. CD44- and CD133-positive cells were distributed evenly within the tumor both in the preoperative chemoradiation therapy group and surgery-alone group, and locational alteration was not observed. The therapy-resistant ability of CD133-positive cells can be associated with poor outcome in the patients with preoperative chemoradiation therapy.

224	Rsf-1 expression in rectal cancer: with special emphasis on the independent prognostic value after neoadjuvant chemoradiation	English	2012	22569540	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22569540	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Preoperatively, radiation therapy was given at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks with 24-h continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil concurrently. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was administered if the pre-treatment (Pre-Tx) or post-treatment (Post-Tx) stage of the tumour was beyond T3 or N1.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is an increasingly used therapeutic strategy for rectal cancer. Clinically, it remains a major challenge to predict therapeutic response and patient outcome after CRT. Rsf-1 (HBXAP), a novel nuclear protein with histone chaperon function, mediates ATPase-dependent chromatin remodelling and confers tumour aggressiveness and predicts therapeutic response in certain carcinomas. However, the expression of Rsf-1 has never been reported in rectal cancer. This study examined the predictive and prognostic impacts of Rsf-1 expression in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant CRT. METHODS: Rsf-1 immunoexpression was retrospectively assessed for pre-treatment biopsies of 172 rectal cancer patients without initial distant metastasis. All of them were treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery. The results were correlated with the clinicopathological features, therapeutic response, tumour regression grade and metastasis-free survival (MeFS), local recurrent-free survival and disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Present in 82 cases (47.7%), high-expression of Rsf-1 was associated with advanced pre-treatment tumour status (T3, T4, p=0.020), advanced post-treatment tumour status (T3, T4, p<0.001) and inferior tumour regression grade (p=0.028). Of note, high-expression of Rsf-1 emerged as an adverse prognosticator for diseases-specific survival (p=0.0092) and significantly predicted worse MeFS (p=0.0006). Moreover, high-expression of Rsf-1 also remained prognostic independent for worse MeFS (HR 2.834; p=0.0214). CONCLUSIONS: High-expression of Rsf-1 is associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcome in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CRT, which confers tumour aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance through chromatin remodelling and represents a potential prognostic biomarker in rectal cancer.

225	Overexpression of ANXA1 confers independent negative prognostic impact in rectal cancersreceiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2014	24810927	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24810927	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	We classified tumors with H scores higher than the median of all scored cases as having high ANXA1 expression.	All 172 patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks with 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was administered if the pre- treatment (Pre-Tx) or post-treatment (Post-Tx) tumor or nodal status was beyond T3 or N1, respectively.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is an increasingly common therapeutic strategy for rectal cancer. Clinically, it remains a major challenge to predict therapeutic response and patient outcomes after CCRT. Annexin I (ANXA1), encoded by ANXA1, is a Ca(2+)/phospholipid-binding protein that mediates actin dynamics and cellular proliferation, as well as suggesting tumor aggressiveness and predicting therapeutic response in certain malignancies. However, expression of ANXA1 has never been reported in rectal cancer receiving CCRT. This study examined the predictive and prognostic impact of ANXA1 expression in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant CCRT. We identified ANXA1 as associated with resistance to CCRT through data mining from a published transcriptomic dataset. Its immunoexpression was retrospectively assessed using H scores on pre-treatment biopsies from 172 rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT followed by curative surgery. Results were correlated with clinicopathological features, therapeutic response, tumor regression grade (TRG), and metastasis-free survival (MeFS), as well as local recurrent-free survival (LRFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). High expression of ANXA1 was associated with advanced pre-treatment tumor status (T3, T4, p = 0.022), advanced pre-treatment nodal status (N1, N2, p = 0.004), advanced post-treatment tumor status (T3, T4, p < 0.001), advanced post-treatment nodal status (N1, N2, p = 0.001) and inferior TRG (p = 0.009). In addition, high expression of ANXA1 emerged as an adverse prognosticator for DSS (p < 0.0001), LRFS (p = 0.0001) and MeFS (p = 0.0004). Moreover, high expression of ANXA1 also remained independently prognostic of worse DSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.998; p = 0.007), LRFS (HR = 3.206; p = 0.028) and MeFS (HR = 3.075; p = 0.017). This study concludes that high expression of ANXA1 is associated with poor therapeutic response and adverse outcomes in rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant CCRT.

Radiation therapy was administered by linear accelerators with 10-15 MV photons. Radiation therapy was simulated to encompass the tumour volume with 5 cm cephalo-caudad-margins and 2 cm radial margins, and treatment ports were designed to include enlarged regional nodes based on CT evaluation and endoscopic ultrasound. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19 and 22-26) to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple-field technique. Surgical resection was performed 4-5 weeks following completion of chemoradiation after clinical restaging using the same procedures as for staging, except for laparoscopy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	We examined the potential of quantitative epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, synonym: c-erbB-1) and c-erbB-2 (synonym: HER2/neu) mRNA expression to predict minor or major histopathologic response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (cis-platinum, 5-FU, 36 Gy), followed by radical surgical resection, in patients with oesophageal cancer. Tissue samples were collected by endoscopic biopsy prior to treatment. RNA was isolated from biopsies and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to determine c-erbB-1 and c-erbB-2 mRNA expression. Relative expression (tumour/paired normal tissue ratio standardised for beta-actin) was calculated for EGFR and c-erbB-2 mRNA. Expression levels were correlated with the objective histopathologic response in resected specimens. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major response when resected specimens contained less than 10% of residual vital tumour cells, or in case a pathologically complete response was achieved. Expression of c-erbB-1 mRNA was not associated with the degree of histomorphological response. In contrast, the relative expression levels of c-erbB-2 mRNA >1 were not associated with major histopathologic responses (sensitivity 41.6%, specificity 100%), and 10 out of 36 (28%) patients could be unequivocally identified, whose tumours did not respond well to the delivered neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (P<0.01). Quantitative expression levels of c-erbB-2, but not c-erbB-1 mRNA, in pretreatment biopsies appear to predict minor histopathologic response to our neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy protocol. This test could be used to prevent expensive, non effective and potentially harmful therapies in approximately one-fourth of our patients, and leads to a more individualised type of combined modality treatment.

Median radiation time was 35 days (range, 29e56 days).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The addition of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior to surgical resection for esophageal cancer has improved clinical outcomes in some trials. Pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant therapy is associated with better clinical outcome in these patients, but only 22% to 40% of patients achieve pCR. Because both chemotherapy and radiotherapy act by inducing DNA damage, we analyzed proteins selected from multiple DNA repair pathways, using quantitative immunohistochemistry coupled with a digital pathology platform, as possible biomarkers of treatment response and clinical outcome. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified 79 patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer between October 1994 and September 2002, with biopsy tissue available, who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital and used their archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples to create tissue microarrays (TMA). TMA sections were stained using antibodies against proteins in various DNA repair pathways including XPF, FANCD2, PAR, MLH1, PARP1, and phosphorylated MAPKAP kinase 2 (pMK2). Stained TMA slides were evaluated using machine-based image analysis, and scoring incorporated both the intensity and the quantity of positive tumor nuclei. Biomarker scores and clinical data were assessed for correlations with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Higher scores for MLH1 (p = 0.018) and lower scores for FANCD2 (p = 0.037) were associated with pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation on multivariable analysis. Staining of MLH1, PARP1, XPF, and PAR was associated with recurrence-free survival, and staining of PARP1 and FANCD2 was associated with overall survival on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNA repair proteins analyzed by immunohistochemistry may be useful as predictive markers for response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer. These results are hypothesis generating and need confirmation in an independent data set.

232	Prognostic value of EGFR and TGF-alpha in early laryngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy	English	1996	8667988	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8667988	Journal Article	\N	68	63	5	\N	63.5	[43.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The cases above the average as (+) and the cases below as (-).	All of patients were treated with irradiation alone (56 to 80 Gy) using a cobalt teletherapy unit with two parallel, lateral opposed fields; one field was treated at each session in the Department of Radiology from 1980 to 1992.	Radiotherapy	5	The purpose of this study was to determine the overexpression of both epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) (a ligand of EGFR) in early laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we attempted to evaluate the prognostic values of our findings. Expression of EGFR and TGF-alpha in tumor tissue was examined immunohistochemically in 68 patients who had been treated with radiotherapy for early laryngeal cancer. Overexpression of the two factors was noted in 42.6% and 55.9%, respectively. No significant differences due to age, tumor size, and location or grade of cancer tissues were seen. Higher survival rates, found in patients with EGFR (-) and TGF-alpha (-) tumors as compared with those with EGFR (+) and TGF-alpha (+) (97.4%, 100% and 86.2%, 86.8%, respectively), were not statistically significant. The recurrence rates were similar between EGFR (+) and EGFR (-) (37.9% and 35.9%, respectively). However, the recurrence rate in patients with TGF-alpha (+) was significantly higher (57.9%) than in those with TGF-alpha (-) (10%; P<.01). Therefore overexpression of TGF-alpha may be an important indicator for recurrence in patients with early laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated by irradiation.

233	Prognostic significance of clinical parameters and biological markers in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	1999	10213215	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10213215	Journal Article	\N	111	94	17	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	TP53 expression was categorized as positive when >10% of the tumor nuclei were stained according to previous reports. BCL2 or BAX immunoreactivity was localized in the cytoplasm of neoplastic cells. The expression of these proteins was categorized according to previous reports as follows: negative, <30% of tumor cells were stained; positive, >30% of tumor cells were stained.	Radiotherapy was administered at a daily dose of 2.5 Gy, four times a week. Carboplatin (100 mg/㎡) was administered i.v. in 250 ml of 5% glucose, once a week, 1 h before radiotherapy. After a dose of 40 Gy was administered, the response of primary and nodal tumors was evaluated by both radiation oncologists and otolaryngologists. If the percentage of tumor shrinkage was ,50% in at least one dimension by endoscopic examination and/or on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging examination, chemoradiotherapy was terminated, and radical surgery was indicated. Otherwise, a total dose of 65 Gy was indicated using a field shrinkage technique. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, salvage surgery was performed, if possible, for residual or recurrent locoregional diseases.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is reported to have a fair clinical outcome with organ preservation for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The aim of this study was to determine whether biological markers are related to proliferative activity or apoptosis of tumor cells and whether clinical factors are associated with a clinical outcome in SCCHN patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Immunostaining with antibodies specific for p53, bcl-2, bax, and MIB-1 was performed to evaluate expression of these proteins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 111 SCCHN patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (carboplatin, 100 mg/m2, four to six times every week; total radiation therapy dose of 40-65 Gy over 4-6.5 weeks). Multivariate analysis indicated that nodal status was a significant indicator of overall survival (OS; P = 0.001) and locoregional control (LRC; P = 0.002). In a univariate analysis, patients with a low MIB-1-positive index (< 40%) had better OS than those with a high MIB-1-positive index (> or = 40%; P = 0.013), although the difference was not statistically significant in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.060). Patients with bcl-2-positive tumors had better LRC than those with bcl-2-negative tumors, based on a multivariate analysis (P = 0.017). No statistically significant association was found between p53 or bax expression and clinical outcome. These results indicate that nodal status is the major prognostic factor in SCCHN patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. In addition, our findings suggest that bcl-2 positivity is associated with better LRC and that the proliferative activity of tumor cells might be prognostic for OS.

234	Predictive and prognostic markers in a series of patients with head and neck squamous cell invasive carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy	English	1995	9815934	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9815934	Journal Article	\N	73	\N	\N	63	\N	[39.0,70.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Briefly, the treatment schedules were: cisplatin (80 mg/㎡) or carboplatin (375 mg/㎡) as short i.v. infusion every 3 weeks on days 1, 21, and 42. Patients allocated to the cisplatin arm also received an adequate i.v. hydration. Radiation therapy was given with external beam megavoltage equipment, starting on day 1 at 200 cGy in daily fractions, 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks, reaching a total dose of 64 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	It has been proposed that diverse anticancer drugs and radiation therapy may induce a mode of cell death with the characteristics of apoptosis. Since apoptosis is under the control of several oncogenes, we analyzed the expression of the protein encoded by the proto-oncogenes bcl-2 and p53. Furthermore, we studied cell proliferation [using PC-10 mAb to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] and vascularization [using the CD-31 mAb and by counting intratumoral microvessel density (IMD)] using immunocytochemistry. A series of 73 patients with clinical stage II-IV squamous cell invasive carcinoma of the head and neck (H&N) were treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cisplatin, 80 mg/m2, versus carboplatin, 375 mg/m2, three times every 3 weeks and a total dose of radiation therapy of 64 Gy in 6-8 weeks). We correlated the expression of these markers, determined prior to treatment, with response to the therapy and prognosis. Bcl-2 protein was expressed in 37.4% of the carcinomas (25/67 evaluable), and it was not significantly associated with any other feature studied. Forty (56. 4%) of the 71 carcinomas evaluable for p53 were p53 positive; the median IMD was 38 microvessels/field at the hot spot (range, 18-80), and the median percentage of nuclei labeled by the PC-10 mAb was 50% (range, 0-95%). In the univariate analysis, regional lymph node negativity (P = 0.016), good performance status (PS) (PS >/= 90; P = 0.044), bcl-2 positivity (P = 0.070), and low vascularization (P = 0. 085) were significantly associated with a higher probability of complete remission. In the multivariate analysis (final model), only IMD (continuous variable; P = 0.045) and PS (P = 0.017) retained significance. As far as prognosis is concerned, in the univariate analysis, patients with tumors with low histological grading (grades 1-2; P = 0.006), p53 negative (P = 0.09), bcl-2 positive (P = 0.08), and high PCNA labeling (P = 0.06) had a significantly better disease-free survival. In the multivariate analysis, only grading (P = 0.003) and p53 (P = 0.04) retained significance for disease-free survival. For overall survival, in the univariate analysis, the following markers were significantly prognostic when only deaths due to progression are considered: response to therapy (P = 0.00001), PS (P = 0.04), nodal status (P = 0.028), PCNA (P = 0.04), p53 (P = 0. 08), and grading (P = 0.01). In the multivariate analysis, only patients who achieved complete response (P = 0.00002), high PCNA values (P = 0.002), and low histological grading (P = 0.01) retained a statistically significant probability of better overall survival. Our results suggest that in this series of H&N cancer patients the markers capable of predicting response to therapy are distinct from those associated with prognosis, once the remission has been achieved. This information is potentially useful to the clinician for developing a more rational therapeutic approach for H&N cancer patients eligible for concurrent chemoradiation therapy.

235	Risk factors for local recurrence after breast-conserving therapy for invasive carcinomas: a case-control study of histological factors and alterations in oncogene expression	English	1999	10477009	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10477009	Journal Article	\N	205	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Scoring was done using a semiquantitative system based on the mean staining intensity (MSI) and an estimation of the percentage of positive tumor cell nuclei (PPN). The MSI could vary from 0 (none), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate ), to 3 (strong). The PPN varied from 0 (0%), 1 (1–25%), 2 (26–50%), 3 (5175%), and 4 (. 75%). The staining score was calculated as the sum of MSI and PPN (range 0, 2–7). The prognostic importance of p53 was analyzed according to the staining score of 0–3 (called TP53-negative) and a score larger or equal to 4 (called TP53-positive). Tumors were considered ERBB2 positive when a clear brown membrane staining was present. Patients having a value greater than or equal to 20% of MKI67-positive cells were deﬁned as having a MKI67-positive tumor. For BCL2, the same cutoff point as for TP53 was used.	Patients underwent surgery in different hospitals and they all received radiation therapy at Leiden University Medical Center. Whole-breast irradiation was followed by a boost dose applied to the tumor bed.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Many studies have focused on histological risk factors for local recurrence (LR) after breast-conserving therapy (BCT). In addition to histological factors, we studied alterations in the expression of various proteins in relation to LR using a case-control approach. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-nine LR occurred in a patient cohort of 1,481 tumors treated with BCT. These patients were randomly matched, each with two controls. Matching was performed for age group (< or = 50 and > 50 years), pN stage, and follow-up time. Histology slides were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for the following proteins: bcl-2, CD31, cyclin D1, E-cadherin, EGF receptor, ER, PR, Ki-67, c-erbB2/neu, and p53. Statistical analyses were performed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Sixty-six cases and 139 controls with invasive carcinoma remained for analysis. The following variables were significant risk factors for LR: young age (p = 0.006), high nuclear grade (p = 0.04), high mitotic count (p = 0.03), extensive DCIS around the tumor (p = 0.02) but not within the tumor, poorly differentiated type of DCIS (p = 0.03), > 20% ki-67 positive cells (p = 0.006), and PR negativity (p = 0.03). When the analysis was performed for patients < or = and > 50 years, these risk factors were found in the older patients, but not in the younger patients. CONCLUSION: High mitotic count and Ki-67 positivity are risk factors for LR. EDCIS surrounding the invasive tumor is a risk factor for LR, especially when of poorly differentiated type. Age is an important risk factor for LR independent of other risk factors, including alterations in oncogene expression.

RTOG0129 was a phase III trial evaluating standard fractionation radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin versus accelerated fractionation by concomitant boost radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin for patients with locally advanced HNSCC (N = 743). RTOG 0234 was a phase II randomized trial testing whether radiation therapy with concurrent cetuximab and either cisplatin or docetaxel improved disease-free survival over a historical cohort of patients treated with radiation therapy and concurrent cisplatin (RTOG9501) for patients at high risk for recurrence after surgical resection of advanced HNSCC (N = 238). RTOG 0522 was a phase III trial testing the addition of cetuximab to radiation therapy with concurrent cisplatin for patients with locally advanced HNSCC (N = 940).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Although p16 protein expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is recognized as a prognostic marker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), its prevalence and significance have not been well established in cancer of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx, collectively referred as non-OPSCC, where HPV infection is less common than in the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: p16 expression and high-risk HPV status in non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Hazard ratios from Cox models were expressed as positive or negative, stratified by trial, and adjusted for clinical characteristics. RESULTS: p16 expression was positive in 14.1% (12 of 85), 24.2% (23 of 95), and 19.0% (27 of 142) and HPV ISH was positive in 6.5% (six of 93), 14.6% (15 of 103), and 6.9% (seven of 101) of non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies, respectively. Hazard ratios for p16 expression were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.95; P = .03) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89; P = .01) for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Comparing OPSCC and non-OPSCC, patients with p16-positive OPSCC have better PFS and OS than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, but patients with p16-negative OPSCC and non-OPSCC have similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Similar to results in patients with OPSCC, patients with p16-negative non-OPSCC have worse outcomes than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, and HPV may also have a role in outcome in a subset of non-OPSCC. However, further development of a p16 IHC scoring system in non-OPSCC and improvement of HPV detection methods are warranted before broad application in the clinical setting.

237	Prognostic value of p53 in muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with preoperative radiotherapy	English	1996	8633392	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8633392	Journal Article	\N	109	84	25	62	61	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Samples with less than 20% positive staining were considered negative for TP53 overexpression.	The bladder and draining pelvic lymph nodes were treated using a four-filed box technique with high-energy photons (≥18 MV) to 50 Gy in 25 fractions. Radical cystectomy was performed 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVES: The relationship of p53 mutations as analyzed immunohistochemically to radiation response and therapeutic outcome was examined in a cohort of 301 patients with muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated relatively uniformly with preoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) 4 to 6 weeks prior to radical cystectomy. METHODS: Adequate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissue for the immunohistochemical staining of p53 using antibody DO1 was obtained in 109 patients. The median follow-up for those living was 91 months. RESULTS: Overall, p53 staining was positive in 56% of the cases, with 60% positive in Stage T2 (n = 48), 42% in Stage T3a (n = 31), and 63% in Stage T3b (n = 30). Overexpression of p53 did not correlate with actuarial local control, distant metastasis freedom, disease freedom, or overall survival. However, significant associations were seen when these analyses were limited to patients with clinical Stage T3b disease. In this subgroup, the actuarial 5-year rates for patients with p53 positively and negatively stained tumors were 55% and 100%, respectively, for distant metastasis freedom (P = 0.01), 51% and 91% for disease freedom (P = 0.04), and 32% and 91% for overall survival (P = 0.006). Cox proportional hazards models that included p53 staining and other prognostic factors of significance in the univariate analyses revealed p53 to be independently predictive of survival for patients with Stage T3b disease. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic value of p53 immunostaining rested with Stage T3b patients. Although no correlations were found with radiation response, p53 positivity in this subgroup was associated with a higher rate of distant metastasis and reduced overall survival. For these patients, p53 negativity would indicate that aggressive local treatment (that is, preoperative radiotherapy and cystectomy) is sufficient, whereas p53 positivity would indicate that multiagent chemotherapy is required because of the increased risk of distant metastasis.

The IRS takes into account both the intensity of staining (graded on a scale of 0 to 3; 0 = no staining, 1 =  faint staining, 2 = moderate staining, 3 = strong staining) and the percentage of positive tumor cells (graded on a scale of 0 to 4; 0 = none, 1 = <10%, 2 = 10-50%, 3 =  50-80%, 4 = >80%). The final score ranges from 0 to 12 and was obtained by multiplying the two parameters.	Although patients in both trials received preoperative chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin, 5-FU, and radiation, the regimens differed slightly. In both studies, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were administered over 30 calendar days. For study J8908, cisplatin at a dose of 26 mg/㎡/day was administered on days 1-5 and 26-30, and 5-FU at a dose of 300 mg/㎡/day was given on days 1-30 by continuous i.v. infusion. For study J9528, cisplatin at a dose of 20 mg/㎡/day was administered on days 1-5 and 26-30, and 5-FU at a dose of 225 mg/㎡/day was given on days 1-30 by continuous i.v. infusion. In each study, radiotherapy was given at a daily dose of 2 Gy to a total dose of 44 Gy.  Esophagogastrectomy was carried out approximately 4 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy in those patients without disease progression. Study J9528 differed from study J8908 in that patients were subsequently treated i.v. with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of 135 mg/㎡ paclitaxel for 24 h on day 1 and 75 mg/㎡ cisplatin on day 2 repeated every 3 weeks for three cycles. paclitaxel for 24 h on day 1 and 75 mg/Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Despite the availability of cellular markers associated with cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, predictive factors for pathological complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS) are few in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. This study evaluates the role of clinical and cellular markers in predicting CR and OS in patients with esophageal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were treated with infusional cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil combined with daily radiotherapy followed by esophagectomy. Pretreatment tumors (n = 54) were analyzed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), bax, and bcl-2 expression by immunohistochemistry and for p53 mutations by direct DNA sequencing of exons 5-8. Clinical covariates included patients' age at enrollment; gender; Barrett's metaplasia; and tumor location, histology, and differentiation. Logistic regression and survival analyses were used to evaluate the predictors. RESULTS: Age ranged from 32 to 75 years; most patients were male (45 male; 9 female); and tumors were distal (47 distal; 7 mid), adenocarcinoma (41 adenocarcinomas; 13 squamous cell carcinomas), and moderately differentiated (33 moderate; 6 well; 15 poor). Female gender predicted CR (odds ratio 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-41). The OS was 43% at 5 years. Presence of CR (P < 0.001 log rank) and p53 mutation (P = 0.051 log rank) correlated with increased OS, whereas increased EGF-R expression predicted poor OS (P = 0.009 log rank). EGF-R remained significant when adjusted for clinical covariates. There was a trend toward increased OS related to better tumor differentiation and decreased bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that EGF-R and p53 mutation may be used as both outcome predictors and targets for molecular therapy for esophageal cancer.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

All patients had a central venous line placed. Patients received docetaxel as intravenously (IV) bolus (at 33 mg/㎡), irinotecan (at 55 mg/ ㎡) as IV bolus, and ﬂuorouracil (at 2g/㎡) infusion over 24 hours once per week for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week without chemoradiotherapy. One cycle was 6 weeks long. If there was no cancer progression after the ﬁrst cycle, patients received a second cycle of the induction chemotherapy. Standard premedications were used. Patients received up to 50.4 Gy of radiotherapy in 28 fractions. Concurrently, patients received docetaxel (20 mg/㎡) IV weekly, irinotecan (30 mg/ ㎡) IV weekly, and ﬂuorouracil (300 mg/㎡in 24 hours as continuous infusion Monday through Friday of each radiotherapy week). Standard premedications were used. Five to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, a complete restaging was performed and surgery was attempted.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The lack of effective treatment for localized esosphageal cancer leads to poor patient outcome. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), a transcriptional factor, is constitutively activated or treatment induced in esophageal cancer and may influence treatment outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pre- and post-treatment cancer specimens from patients enrolled onto a clinical trial were studied for the expression of activated NF-kappaB protein and it was correlated with histologic features, pathologic response, metastatic potential, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Forty-three patients undergoing the same therapy on a protocol were studied. Twenty-one (72%) of 29 patients achieving less than complete pathologic response (pathCR) had NF-kappaB positive cancer, but only one (7%) of 14 patients achieving pathCR had NF-kappaB positive cancer (P = < .001). Activated NF-kappaB was significantly associated with aggressive pathologic features such as perineural, lymphatic, and/or vascular invasion (P = .0004). Eight (38%) of 21 NF-kappaB positive patients developed metastases compared to none of 22 NF-kappaB negative patients (P = .001). At a median follow-up of 23 months, 10 (48%) of 21 NF-kappaB positive patients had died compared to only one (5%) of 22 NF-kappaB negative patients (P = .0013). Observations were similar for DFS (P = .0006). In a multivariate model (using baseline stage, pathCR or less than pathCR, age, presence of metastatic lymph nodes in the surgical specimen, and NF-kappaB expression) NF-kappaB activation was the only independent predictor of DFS (P = .010) and OS (P = .015). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that esophageal cancers with activated NF-kappaB have aggressive clinical biology and poor treatment outcome. Additional understanding of NF-kappaB regulated pathways may uncover potential therapeutic targets.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	T2: 5 patients, T3: 38 patients; N0: 11 patients, N1: 32 patients.
240	Low expression of Bax predicts poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy	English	2007	17634542	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17634542	Journal Article	\N	63	61	2	63	\N	[38.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Expression of the apoptosis-related proteins was quantified using a visual grading system based on the extent of staining (percentage of positive tumor cells; graded on a scale of 0 to 4: 0, none; 1, 1-25%; 2, 26-50%; 3, 51-75%; 4, >75%) and the intensity of staining (graded on a scale of 0 to 3: 0, no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; 3, strong staining). Therefore, we presented the extent of staining, which was classified into high (grades 2-4) and low (grades 0 and 1).	After completion of diagnostic workup, chemotherapy and radiotherapy were started on the same day. Cisplatin 25 mg/㎡/day and 5-fluorouracil 1,000 mg/㎡/day were administered as a continuous i.v. infusion on days 1 to 3. Two cycles of chemotherapy were done during radiotherapy at 4-week intervals. Three or four weeks after completion of radiotherapy, two more cycles of FP (5-fluorouracil and cisplatin) chemotherapy with the same dose were given at 3- or 4-week intervals. In cases of partial or complete response (CR) after planned chemoradiotherapy, additional cycles of chemotherapy were administered according to the decision of the physicians. In cases of resectable disease at the time of diagnosis with response after concurrent chemoradiotherapy using two cycles of FP, a proportion of the patients underwent esophagectomy 4 to 6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy according to the discretion of the physicians. In these patients, adjuvant chemotherapy with FP was done after surgery if possible. All patients received external beam radiotherapy using 6 or 15 MV LINAC (CLINAC 2100CD, Varian Medical Systems). The initial treatment volume included the primary tumor with a radial margin of 1.5 to 2 cm and a proximal and distal margin of 5 cm and enlarged lymph nodes. The celiac trunk was generally irradiated for lower thoracic esophageal lesions. Two-dimensional or three-dimensional treatment plans using CT scans were done. A total radiation dose of 45 to 64.4 Gy (1.8 to 2 Gy/fraction, 5 days a week) was delivered with 3- or 4-field technique. The dose to the spinal cord was limited within 40 to 45 Gy, and the treatment field was reduced after 45 to 50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The present study evaluated the prognostic significance of apoptosis-related proteins, p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and galectin-3 in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 63 patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (squamous cell carcinoma: 62; adenocarcinoma: 1; stages II-IV) were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy using 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin combined with radiotherapy. Pretreatment tumor biopsy specimens were analyzed for p53, Bcl-2, Bax, and galectin-3 expression by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: High expression of Bax, p53, Bcl-2, and galectin-3 was observed in 67%, 47%, 24%, and 29% of patients, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) of total patients was 14 months with 16% of 3-year OS. High expression of p53, Bcl-2, and galectin-3 did not show correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics, including patient outcome. Low expression of Bax was significantly correlated with lack of clinical complete response (P=0.023). Low expression of Bax was also associated with poor OS (median, 8 months versus 16 months; P=0.0008) in univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, low expression of Bax was the most significant independent predictor of poor OS (P=0.009), followed by low dose intensity of cisplatin and lack of clinical complete response. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of Bax was significantly associated with the poor survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy using 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Immunohistochemical staining for Bax with a pretreatment biopsy specimen might be useful to select the optimal treatment options for these patients.

241	High cyclooxygenase-2 expression following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy is associated with minor histopathologic response and poor prognosis in esophageal cancer	English	2005	16322294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16322294	Journal Article	\N	52	42	10	57.7000000000000028	\N	[29.5,72.8)	Immunohistochemistry	The results were graded on a scale of 0 to 3 based on the percentage of specific tumor cell staining: grade 0, no specific PTGS2 staining or <5% of the tumor cells; grade 1, ≥5% to <35% of the tumor cells; grade 2, ≥35% to <65% of the tumor cells; grade 3, ≥65% tumor cells. Grades 0 and 1 were considered low PTGS2 protein expression and grades 2 and 3 as high PTGS2 protein expression.	Cisplatin (20 mg/㎡/d) was administered as short-term infusion on days 1 to 5 and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/㎡/d) as continuous infusion over 24 hours on days 1 to 5. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26) to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple field technique. Standardized transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy was done 4 to 5 weeks following completion of radiochemotherapy in all patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: High expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was shown to inhibit chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced apoptosis. We analyzed the association of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression with histomorphologic response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-two patients with resectable esophageal cancers (cT2-4, Nx, and M0) received neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-5-fluorouracil, 36 Gy) followed by transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major response when resected specimens contained less than 10% of residual vital tumor cells. RNA was isolated from endoscopic biopsies (paired tumor and normal tissue) before neoadjuvant treatment and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (Taqman) assays were done to determine COX-2 mRNA expression levels standardized for beta-actin. COX-2 protein expression in pretreatment biopsies and post-therapeutic resection specimens was analyzed by immunostaining of tumor cells. RESULTS: Median COX-2 mRNA expression levels were significantly (P < 0.0001) different between paired tumor (median, 2.2) and normal tissues (median, 0.159). Comparison of pre-therapeutic and posttherapeutic specimens showed a significant difference (P < 0.006) in COX-2 protein expression. Twelve of 52 tumors showed down-regulation and 3 of 52 showed up-regulation of COX-2 protein expression during neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. High COX-2 protein expression in post-therapeutic resection specimens was significantly associated with minor histopathologic response (P < 0.04) and poor prognosis (5-year survival probabilities: 26.3 +/- 8.2% for minor and 58.6% +/- 12.9% for major histopathologic response; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: High COX-2 protein expression following neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in resection specimens is significantly associated with minor histopathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy and very poor prognosis.

242	Impact of epidermal growth factor receptor expression on survival and pattern of relapse in patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma	English	2002	12499279	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12499279	Journal Article	White; Non-white; Not specified	155	105	50	61	\N	[30.0,86.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	155 of 268 (58%) patients (30% had stage III disease, and 66% had stage IV disease) randomized to the conventional radiotherapy (70 Gy in 7 weeks) arm.	Radiotherapy	5	A correlative study was performed to address the impact of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression on survival and pattern of failure in patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) enrolled in a Phase III trial and randomized to receive conventional radiotherapy. The study population comprised 155 of 268 (58%) randomized patients with sufficient pretreatment biopsy specimens for immunohistochemical assay. The specimens were dewaxed and incubated after standard preparation with mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing the extracellular domain of the EGFR molecule. The catalyzed product was visualized with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine Chromogen Kit and lightly counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Quantitative EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done with SAMBA 4000 Cell Image Analysis System, without knowledge of the clinical outcome, to yield mean absorbance (MOD), staining index (SI), and quick score (QS). These EGFR IHC parameters were correlated with the T stage, N stage, combined stage grouping, and recursive partitioning analysis classes. Subsequently, the EGFR parameters were correlated with the outcome end points, i.e., overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), local-regional (LR) relapse, and distant metastasis rates. We found that HNSCCs exhibited a wide variation in EGFR expression (MOD, 0.2-66.0; SI, 0.3-97.0; QS, 0.01-69.9) with a relatively strong but nonlinear correlation between MOD and SI (r = 0.79). There was no correlation between EGFR expression and T stage, N stage, stage grouping, and recursive partitioning analysis classes (r = -0.07 to 0.17). The OS and DFS rates of patients with high EGFR-expressing HNSCCs (>median MOD) were highly significantly lower (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.0016, respectively) and the LR relapse rate was highly significantly higher (P = 0.0031) compared with those of patients with low EGFR-expressing HNSCCs. However, there was no difference in the distant metastasis rate between the two groups (P = 0.96). Significant correlations, although somewhat less robust than MOD, were also observed between SI and QS and the OS, DFS, and LR relapse rates. Multivariate analysis showed that EGFR expression was an independent determinant of survival and a robust independent predictor of LR relapse. In summary, this correlative study in a large series of patients revealed that EGFR expression, which varied considerably among HNSCCs, was a strong independent prognostic indicator for OS and DFS and a robust predictor for LR relapse but not for distant metastasis. The data suggest that EGFR IHC should be considered for selecting patients for more aggressive combined therapies or enrollment into trials targeting EGFR signaling pathways.

243	Coexpression of hypoxia-inducible factors 1alpha and 2alpha, carbonic anhydrase IX, and vascular endothelial growth factor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and relationship to survival	English	2002	12171890	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12171890	Journal Article	\N	90	73	17	45	\N	[21.0,67.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumor with 5% positive cells for the marker was defined as low expression. Tumor with 5% or more positive cells was defined as high expression.	Eligible patients were randomized to receive either standard radiotherapy alone or the same radiotherapy given concurrently with weekly 40 mg/㎡ cisplatin for up to 8 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia is known to be associated with resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and poorer survival. Recently, it is shown that hypoxia induces the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and 2alpha (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha), which then up-regulates the expression of downstream genes such as carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, CA IX, and VEGF by immunohistochemistry in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) biopsies from 90 consecutive patients recruited between 1994 and 1997 in a randomized controlled trial of chemoradiation in locally advanced NPC and investigated their relationship with survival. RESULTS: HIF-1alpha was expressed in 52 of 90 (58%), HIF-2alpha in 6 of 89 (7%), CA IX in 51 of 90 (57%), and VEGF in 54 of 90 (60%) of tumors. Tumor HIF-1alpha expression correlated significantly with that of CA IX (P = 0.008) and VEGF (P = 0.003). High tumor HIF-1alpha expression was associated with a trend for poor overall survival (P = 0.06). Tumors with a positive hypoxic profile (defined as high expression of both HIF-1alpha and CA9) were associated with worse progression-free survival (P = 0.04). Tumors with both hypoxic and angiogenic profile (defined as high VEGF expression) were associated with a worse progression-free survival (P = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: Overexpression of HIF-1alpha, CA IX, and VEGF is common in NPC, which is probably related to hypoxia up-regulated expression involving a HIF-dependent pathway, and is associated with poor prognosis. Targeting the hypoxia pathway may be useful in the treatment of NPC.	Clinical Cancer Research	T1: 20 patients, T2: 48 patients, T3: 22 patients; N1: 7 patients, N2: 51 patients, N3: 32 patients.
244	P53 overexpression in head and neck carcinoma and radiotherapy results	English	1996	8567333	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8567333	Journal Article	\N	79	51	28	\N	63.5	[35.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Seventy-eight patients received a radiation dose of 50-63 Gy in 20-30 fractions, five fractions a week. Only one patient received a dose of 65 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: P53 gene mutations are the common genetic changes encountered in human cancers, and there is extensive evidence that the P53 status may determine tumor response to therapy. This study was carried out to investigate whether there is any correlation between accumulation (overexpression) of P53 protein and poor prognosis in patients with head and neck carcinomas treated with radical radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-nine patients with head and neck carcinomas who were diagnosed and treated in 1989-90 with curative radiotherapy were studied retrospectively. Paraffin sections from archival material were studied using immunohistochemical staining (IHC) with mouse monoclonal antibodies (D0-7) to human P53 protein. Univariate and multivariate analysis of loco-regional tumor control and patient survival were performed on possible prognostic factors. RESULTS: Forty-two (53%) patients showed positive IHC staining in their tumors. Fifty-three percent of the laryngeal, 64% of the oropharyngeal, and 43% of the oral cavity carcinomas showed P53 overexpression. All tumor specimens with vascular, lymphatic, and/or sarcolemmal invasion showed P53 overexpression. The proportion of tumor-stained nuclei was higher in the poorly differentiated than in the well and moderately differentiated tumors (p < 0.05), but there was no correlation with the patient overall or disease-free 5-year actuarial survival. There was no difference in the 5-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival between patients with P53 immunostaining in their tumors and those with no immunostaining (59% vs. 65% and 57% vs. 51%, respectively). The TNM tumor stage was the most significant prognostic factor with 5-year actuarial survival of 87% for early and 14% for late stages (p << 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between immunostaining and history of smoking (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that the P53 accumulation as detected by immunohistochemical staining in a group of head and neck carcinomas was not predictive of patient's poor survival or disease-free survival. Multivariate statistical analysis showed that the TNM tumor stage was the only significant prognostic factor. There was a significant association between P53 accumulation and smoking.

246	Immunohistochemical study identifying prognostic biomolecular markers in nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated by radiotherapy	English	2011	21928418	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21928418	Journal Article	\N	38	30	8	48	\N	[25.0,74.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Thirty-two of 38 patients were treated with induction chemotherapy with 2 or 3 cycles of a cisplatin-based regimen followed by either radiotherapy alone (19 patients) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with cisplatin (13 patients). Since May 2004, all patients were treated with intensity-modulated radio- therapy (IMRT) using integrated boost simultaneously.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: We evaluated the predictive significance of 14 reported markers using immunohistochemical study in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: Immunohistochemical stainings were done in 38 patients for Met, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nm23-H1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p63, early growth response factor 1 (Egr1), chromosome segregation 1-like (CSE1L), cathepsin-D (aspartyl protease), C-erbB2, p53, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT3/STAT5), CD138 (Syndecan-1), and LIN28 with the usual methods. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 30 months (11-83 months). High Met and CD138 expression were statistically significant negative prognostic factors on survival. The expression of Egr1 had a positive prognostic effect on survival. The combined score of these 3 markers, Met plus CD138 minus Egr1, was a strong prognostic factor. The median survival curve was distinctly separated in accord with this combined score. No prognostic value was revealed in COX-2, nm23-H1, EGFR, p63, CSE1L, cathepsin-D, C-erbB2, p53, STAT3, STAT5, and LIN28. CONCLUSIONS: The combined score of these markers could be used to stratify biomolecular risk groups.

Postoperative radiotherapy was 60 Gy in 30 fractions.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To assess the role of biomarker levels in predicting radiotherapy (RT) response in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of buccal mucosa treated with postoperative RT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with squamous cell carcinoma of buccal mucosa who received postoperative RT were enrolled for the study. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity were analysed from primary tumour and adjacent normal mucosa of the same patients before RT. p53 and p21ras were localized immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Enzyme activation was predicted by comparing the levels of these enzymes in tumour and adjacent normal mucosa. Deactivation of GST, activation of GR, SOD and catalase were associated with poor response to RT. p53 immunoreactivity was associated with failure to respond to RT. CONCLUSIONS: These markers may be useful in predicting treatment outcome in patients receiving postoperative RT, although this conclusion requires confirmation in a larger group of patients.

248	p21WAF1 expression is associated with improved survival after adjuvant chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer	English	2000	11015084	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11015084	Journal Article	White; Black; Hispanic	90	48	42	\N	63	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors were considered positive for TP53 immunoreactivity when more than 33% of the nuclei exhibited staining and considered positive for CDKN1A immunoreactivity when more than 5% of nuclei exhibited staining.	Sixty-one patients (68%) received external beam radiation and/or chemotherapy. Twenty-nine of the 44 patients who underwent resection (66%) received postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation. Standard therapy included external beam irradiation to the pancreatic bed and regional lymphatics (5040-5400 cGy) with concurrent infusional 5-FU (before January 1998) or infusional 5-FU and weekly gemcitabine (after January 1998). Three patients with resected pancreatic cancer received chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone; 12 patients with resected pancreatic cancer declined further treatment. Twenty-seven patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer (59%) also received both combined radiation and chemotherapy (locally unresectable disease) or chemotherapy alone (distant metastases).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Cell cycle arrest after DNA damage is partly mediated through the transcriptional activation of p21(WAF1) by the p53 tumor suppressor gene. p21(WAF1) and p53 are both critical in maintaining cell cycle control in response to DNA damage from radiation or chemotherapy. Therefore, we examined the role of p21(WAF1) and p53 in the determination of outcome for patients who receive radiation and/or chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: p21(WAF1) and p53 protein expression were determined (with the use of immunohistochemistry) in specimens from 90 patients with pancreatic cancer. Forty-four patients underwent surgical resection, and 46 patients had either locally unresectable tumors (n = 9 patients) or distant metastases (n = 37 patients). Seventy-three percent of the patients who underwent resection and 63% of the patients who did not undergo resection received radiation and/or chemotherapy. RESULTS: p21(WAF1) expression was present in 48 of 86 tumors (56%) and was significantly (P<.05) associated with advanced tumor stage. Median survival among patients with resected pancreatic cancer who received adjuvant chemoradiation with p21(WAF1)-positive tumors was significantly longer than in patients with no p21(WAF1) staining (25 vs. 11 months; P = .01). Fifty of 89 tumors (56%) stained positive for p53 protein. p53 overexpression was associated with decreased survival in patients who did not undergo resection. CONCLUSIONS: Normal p21(WAF1) expression may be necessary for a beneficial response to current adjuvant chemoradiation protocols for pancreatic cancer. Alternate strategies for adjuvant therapy should be explored for patients with pancreatic cancer who lack functional p21(WAF1).

249	Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen predicts response of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma to chemoradiotherapy	English	1994	7915963	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7915963	Journal Article	\N	14	10	4	63	\N	[41.0,74.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Specimens with a total score of 4 or less were arbitratily designated EGFR-negative; those with a score of 5 or greater were designated EGFR-positive. A PCNA score greated tha 40 was taken as PCNA-positive.	The chemoradiotherapy regimen consists of 5-fluorouracil, 15 mg/kg intravenously over 16 hours daily for 5 days (days 1-5), followed by a day of rehydration (day 6) and cisplatin, 75 mg/㎡ intravenously over 8 houors on day 7. This regimen is repeated on week 6. Over weeks 1 to 3, patients also receive concurrent radiotherapy to a total dose of 40 Gy in 15 fractions. Esophagectomy is planned for week 8.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Multimodality therapy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by surgery may improve survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma compared with each of the individual treatment options. Histologic assessment of resected tumors after chemoradiotherapy shows that some patients have a complete response with no residual tumor, whereas other patients derive no benefit. The ability to predict response to chemoradiotherapy would allow treatment to be planned accordingly. METHODS: Expression of the tumor growth and proliferation proteins epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was determined using immunohistochemical staining of pretreatment endoscopic biopsies from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who were randomized to chemoradiotherapy before surgery. Response to chemoradiotherapy was assessed by histologic examination of the resected specimens. Response to chemoradiotherapy and survival were correlated with EGFR and PCNA expression individually and with both markers combined as EGFR/PCNA.RESULTS: Of 14 patients available for study, 6 had a complete histologic response (CR) to chemoradiotherapy with no residual tumor in the resected specimen, 3 had a partial response (PR) to chemoradiotherapy, and the remaining 5 had minimal response (MR). Of the nine patients with a CR or PR, tumors of eight patients were negative for one or both markers. Of the five patients with an MR, four tumors were positive for both EGFR and PCNA (P < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). Comparison of survival from the date of randomization shows that patients with tumors negative for one or both markers had a significant survival advantage (P = 0.0003, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of PCNA and EGFR status of pretreatment biopsies may identify a group of patients likely to derive the greatest benefit from chemoradiotherapy before surgery in terms of histologic response and long term survival.

250	CDC25B and p53 are independently implicated in radiation sensitivity for human esophageal cancers	English	2000	11156245	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11156245	Journal Article	\N	47	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Concerning TP53 and CCND1 staining, when ≥10% of the cancer cells showed positive staining, the tumors were evaluated as positive. 	Forty-seven patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus had undergone radiation therapy, followed by surgical resection. Patients received a total dose of 40 or 60 Gy over 4 or 6 weeks, 2 Gy a day, five fractions a week, in combination with continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/㎡ per day) and a single infusion of cisplatin (10 mg/body per day) on each day. A 10-MeV high energy linear accelerator was used to deliver radiation to the mediastinum and the neck.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Ionized radiation leads to G1 arrest and apoptosis by a p53-dependent pathway and G2-M arrest through a p53-independent pathway. In this study, we evaluated the role of cell cycle-regulating molecules in the sensitivity of cancer cells for radiation therapy. Forty-seven patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus had undergone radiation therapy, followed by surgical resection. They were classified as sensitive to radiation (SR, 14 cases) with no residual tumor in the surgical specimen or as resistant to radiation (RR, 33 cases) with viable residual tumors. Their preradiation biopsy samples were immunohistochemically investigated for the expressions of cell cycle-related molecules, including p53, CDC25A, CDC25B, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and Ki-67. p53 expression was negative in 71% (10 of 14) of SR and positive in 91% (30 of 33) of RR. The association was strong between high radiation sensitivity and negative p53 expression (P < 0.0001). CDC25B, which is not expressed in normal epithelium but is in the cytoplasm of esophageal cancers, was strongly expressed (2+) in 46% (6 of 14) of SR and in 6% (2 of 23) of RR. Thus, the sensitivity for radiation therapy was significantly correlated with CDC25B overexpression. With respect to CDC25A, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, and Ki-67, no statistically significant differences were found in their expressions between SR and RR tumors. p53 and CDC25B expressions showed no significant associations, and multivariate analysis revealed that both p53 and CDC25B are significant independent markers for predicting radiation sensitivity. CDC25B was revealed to be a novel predictor of radiation sensitivity in esophageal cancers. Because CDC25B is an oncogene, which affects G2-M progression, these results suggest the importance of a p53-independent G2-M checkpoint in radiation therapy.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

A positive immunoreaction of BCL2 and MYC was deﬁned as diffuse cytoplasmic staining in neoplastic cells. TP53 immunoreactivity was deﬁned as nuclear reactivity of neoplastic cells.	A total dose of 6000-6480 cGy was given in 180-200 cGy daily fractions, 5 days a week.	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: We assessed the role of apoptosis and the expression of bcl-2, p53, and c-myc oncoproteins in pretreatment histologic specimens as a predictor of response to radiation therapy and survival in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. METHODS: Pretreatment biopsy specimens of 68 patients with NSCLC (62 squamous cell carcinoma, 6 adenocarcinoma) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. From 5 high-powered fields, the apoptotic index (AI) was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic tumor cells to the total number of tumor cells. Bcl-2, p53, and c-myc oncoprotein expression was detected by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Twenty-nine cases showed partial or complete remission, whereas 39 showed no response. AI ranged from 0.2 to 12.0% (mean +/- SD; 4.3 +/- 2.6%, median 4.0%). There was no difference in AI between responders (4.0 +/- 2.3) and nonresponders (4.5 +/- 2.8, p > 0.05). However, in the responders, AI was correlated with the degree of change in tumor volume (r = 0.41, p < 0.05). In an analysis of 53 subjects who survived more than 1 month after the completion of radiation therapy, the patients with a higher AI (n = 27, MST = 22.8 m) survived longer than those with a lower AI (n = 26, MST = 9.2, log-rank, p = 0.03). Patients expressing bcl-2 had poorer survival (n = 22, MST = 6.0 m) than patients without bcl-2 (n = 31, 22.8 m, p < 0.003). According to multivariate analysis, three variables, bcl-2 expression, AI, and response to radiation, were independent prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSION: A low level of spontaneous apoptosis and expression of apoptosis blocking bcl-2 protein in pretreatment histology predict a poor prognosis for radiation-treated NSCLC patients.

The chemoradiation regimen consisted of radiation (40 Gy) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil (total dose: 7,500-8,000 mg/㎡) and cis- platin (total dose: 140-200 mg/㎡). Radiation was administered via a 10-MV X-ray linear accelerator. Bilateral supraclavicular nodes and the upper mediastinum were also included in the T-shaped field. Radiation was delivered daily for 5 days per week at a rate of 200 cGy/day for a total of 40 Gy via parallel-opposed anterior and posterior portals. 5-Fluorouracil, 750-800 mg/㎡/day, was administered by continuous intravenous infusion on days 1-5 and 22-26. Cisplatin, 70-100 mg/㎡/day was administered by drip infusion for 4 h with sufficient pre- and posthydration to maintain sufficient urinary output.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Immunohistochemical staining for metallothionein (MT) and p53 was performed on biopsy specimens of 30 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who had received curative resection following preoperative chemoradiation. The pathologic response to chemoradiation was a partial response in 19 cases and no change was observed in 11 cases. In 16 cases with MT-positive tumor, 10 (62.5%) showed no change. In 14 cases with MT-negative tumor, 13 (92.8%) showed partial response. In 8 patients with negative staining for p53 and MT, 7 were responders, whereas in 9 patients with positive staining for p53 and MT, 6 were nonresponders. The pathologic response was significantly associated with the prognosis (p = 0. 0167). The survival rate of the responders was significantly better than that of the nonresponders. These findings suggest that MT might be a prognostic marker, and consequently we can select the patients who will benefit from preoperative chemoradiation.	Oncology	\N

A total radiation dose of 40 Gy was applied; 2-Gy fractions were delivered daily for 4 weeks by a 10-MV linear accelerator to the mediastinum and the neck. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of daily administration of cisplatin 7-10 mg/㎡ by intravenous fusion for 2h and 5-fluorouracil 350-500 mg/㎡ as a continuous intravenous infusion for 24h. The therapy was administered 5 days per week for 4 weeks, completely synchronized with the irradiation.

METHODS: The expression of p53, CDC25B and MT was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using biopsy specimens taken before CRT for 77 patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and correlated with the pathological effects of CRT and survival. RESULTS: p53-positive tumours and MT-positive tumours had a poor response to CRT, whereas tumours with strong CDC25B expression were associated with a good response. When each patient was scored for the presence of the three biological factors, there was a strong correlation between the sensitivity score and the pathological effect of CRT (P < 0.001), and a (non-significant) difference in the 5-year survival rate between patients with a high score and those with a low score (67 versus 34 per cent respectively; P = 0.12). CONCLUSION: The combined evaluation of p53, CDC25B and MT may help to identify patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma who will benefit from preoperative CRT.

253	Is MIB-1 proliferation index a predictor for response to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with esophageal cancer?	English	2000	11004343	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11004343	Journal Article	\N	42	37	5	\N	58	[37.0,74.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy was administered concomitantly with chemotherapy for 4 weeks at 5 days a week. A total dose of 36 Gy was applied at daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on days 1 to 5 for 4 weeks. In addition patients received 500 mg/㎡ 5-ﬂuorouracil on days 1 to 5 for 4 weeks and 20 mg/㎡ cisplatin on days 1 to 5 in the ﬁrst and fourth week. After a break of at least 4 weeks, restaging and resection were performed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The overall survival rate for patients with an esophageal cancer remains poor. As a consequence, preoperative chemoradiation was introduced for patients with tumor stage T >1 M0 regardless of tumor histology or localization. However, factors predicting response to this therapy pretherapeutically are largely unknown. METHODS: Clinical results of preoperative chemoradiation were investigated. The rates of proliferation and apoptosis were determined in pretherapeutic tumor samples and correlated with tumor response and long-term survival after surgery. RESULTS: A complete tumor response due to chemoradiation (n = 42; cervically localized tumors excluded) was achieved in 11 patients (26%) after resection. Five-year survival rate was significantly improved in these patients compared with those who did not respond to chemoradiation (48% versus 5.5%; P = 0.003). Chemoradiation was performed without benefit in 43%. Perioperative hospital mortality rate was 14.3% in all patients. No correlation of apoptosis with response to chemoradiation or postoperative long-term survival was observed. However, there was a clear correlation between the proliferation rate as determined by MIB-1 immunohistology. Five-year survival rate of patients with a proliferation index (PI) >/=39% was 38% compared with 0% in tumors with a PI <39%. Tumors with a PI >/=39% responded to chemoradiation in 71.4%, but 100% of tumors with a PI <39% did not. Mean survival time of these patients was 33 months and 11 months, respectively (P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the PI may be used for stratification of patients treatment prior surgery. However, these results need further validation in larger patient numbers in the search for factors indicating response pretherapeutically to preoperative chemoradiation in esophageal cancer.

254	Cyclin D1 overexpression associates with radiosensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma	English	2001	11410884	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11410884	Journal Article	\N	41	28	13	\N	61.2000000000000028	[44.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For CCND1 staining, scores were ranked as: scores were negative if <10% of the tumor cells were positive and positive if ≥10% of the tumor cells were positive.	The mean of total dose was 30.2 Gy (24-32 Gy). All cases were operated on 2 to 3 weeks after the radiation therapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Overexpression of cyclin D1, a G1 cell cycle regulator, is often found in many different tumor types, including oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that cyclin D1 levels can influence radiosensitivity in various cell lines. This study evaluated the relationship between cyclin D1 expression levels and radiosensitivity in nine oral SCC cell lines (HSC2, HSC3, HSC4, SCC15, SCC25, SCC66, SCC111, Ca9-22, and NAN2) and 41 clinical patients with oral SCC who underwent preoperative radiation therapy. Radiosensitivity of the nine oral SCC cell lines differed greatly in their response to radiation, assessed by a standard colony formation assay. Likewise, the expression of cyclin D1 varied, and the magnitude of the cyclin D1 expression correlated with increased tumor radiosensitivity. The similar significant association between the response to preoperative radiation therapy and cyclin D1 overexpression was observed in the oral SCC patients who were treated with preoperative radiation therapy. These results suggest that cyclin D1 expression levels correlate to radiosensitivity and could be used to predict the effectiveness of radiation therapy on oral SCC.

293	Integrating epidermal growth factor receptor assay with clinical parameters improves risk classification for relapse and survival in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2011	20732768	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20732768	Journal Article	\N	533	422	111	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patientsreceive accelerated or conventional radiation regimens in a Phase III trial.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression has been consistently found to be an independent predictor of local-regional relapse (LRR) after radiotherapy. We assessed the extent by which it can refine risk classification for overall survival (OS) and LRR in patients with head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: EGFR expression in locally advanced HNSCC was measured by immunohistochemistry in a series of patients randomized to receive accelerated or conventional radiation regimens in a Phase III trial. Subsequently, data of the two series were pooled (N = 533) for conducting a recursive partitioning analysis that incorporated clinical parameters (e.g., performance status, primary site, T and N categories) and four molecular markers (EGFR, p53, Ki-67, and microvessel density). RESULTS: This study confirmed that patients with higher than median levels of tumor EGFR expression had a lower OS (relative risk [RR]: 1.90, p = 0.0010) and a higher LRR (RR: 1.91, p = 0.0163). Of the four markers analyzed, only EGFR was found to contribute to refining classification of patients into three risk classes with distinct OS and LRR outcomes. The addition of EGFR to three clinical parameters could identify patients having up to a fivefold difference in the risk of LRR. CONCLUSIONS: Adding pretreatment EGFR expression data to known robust clinical prognostic variables improved the estimation of the probability for OS and LRR after radiotherapy. Its use for stratifying or selecting patients with defined tumor feature and pattern of relapse for enrollment into clinical trials testing specific therapeutic strategy warrants further investigation.

Patients with locally advanced tumours without distant metastases were treated with radical radiotherapy with curative intention consisting of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and intra luminal brachytherapy (ILB) (patients in group I were treated with 50 Gy EBRT + 15 Gy ILB, i.e. the ‘low-dose group’, from 1987 to 1991; patients in group II were treated with 60 Gy EBRT + 12 Gy ILB, i.e. the ‘high-dose group’, from 1992 to 1994).	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wildtype p53 protein plays an important role in the cellular response to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging agents and is mutated in many human tumours. We evaluated the relationship of the immunohistochemically determined p53 protein status and the disease control with radiotherapy alone for carcinoma of the oesophagus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunostaining for p53 protein was performed on paraffin-embedded specimens from 69 patients with adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. All patients were treated by radiotherapy exclusively, consisting of a combination of external irradiation and intraluminal brachytherapy, using two different dose levels. RESULTS: Fifty-four percent (37/69) of the tumours showed overexpression of the p53 protein. No difference in pre-treatment parameters for p53-positive and p53-negative cases was detected. In multivariate analysis p53 was significantly associated with overall survival (OS) next to weight loss, tumour stage and N-stage. For metastatic-free survival (MFS) p53 status proved to be the sole independent prognostic factor. The influence of p53 on local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), however, was not as strong as on OS and MFS. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemically detected overexpression of mutated p53 protein in oesophagus carcinoma was an independent prognostic factor in a group of patients treated with radiotherapy alone.

256	Bax to Bcl-2 ratio and Ki-67 index are useful predictors of neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy in bladder cancer	English	2004	15078907	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15078907	Journal Article	\N	62	47	15	68	\N	[45.0,89.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All the patients received preoperative chemotherapy with cis-diamino-dichloro-platinum (CDDP) intravenously and radiotherapy. The regimen (based on the method by Shipley et al.) was CDDP (70 mg/㎡) on day 1, with radiation administered from day 2 by Liniac to the true pelvis at 1.8 grays (Gy) per fraction on five consecutive days per week. This therapy was repeated at 14-day intervals, and between one and three cycles of therapy. On the completion of one cycle of CRT, the patients were treated with 70 mg/㎡ of CDDP and 16.2 Gy of irradiation to the target tumor cells.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: In this study, locally advanced bladder cancer was treated by radiation combined with cisplatin therapy and a retrospective analysis was conducted to predict the clinical response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) based on the immunohistochemistry of apoptosis-related proteins. METHODS: Sixty-two patients (median age, 68 years; range, 45-89 years) with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (pT1G3-pT4M0) treated with CRT (median dose: 40.5 Gy of radiation and 230 mg of cisplatin) were studied. Mucosal biopsy was performed before and after CRT. Paraffin-embedded tumor specimens were examined with TUNEL and were immunostained for Ki-67, p53, Bcl-2 and Bax; the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and apoptosis index (AI) were calculated. Clinical features of the patients and response to CRT were compared with data obtained from examination of the tumors. RESULTS: The 62 patients had a median follow-up period of 34 months (range, 3-84 months). Responses to CRT were as follows: CR, 34%; PR, 45%; NC, 21%. The survival rate of patients with Ki-67-positive tumors was significantly lower than those of patients with Ki-67-negative tumors (P < 0.05). No significant correlation was observed between the expression of any protein, the AI and the clinical response. However, the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio showed a significant association with the CR rate (P = 0.0289). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the combined assessment of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression may be used to predict a clinical response to CRT based on the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio determined before therapy. The Ki-67 index may be a useful predictor of prognosis in patients treated by CRT.	Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology	T1: 12 patients, T2: 20 patients, T3: 25 patients, T4: 5 patients.
257	Lack of M30 expression correlates with factors reflecting tumor progression in rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiotherapy	English	2014	24649315	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24649315	Journal Article	\N	72	54	18	64	\N	[35.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	77 patients with rectal cancer received preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with rectal cancer were treated with short-course (a dose of 20 Gy in 4 fractions) or long-course (a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions) radiotherapy using a 4-field box technique with concurrent chemotherapy to take advantage of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) radiosensitization. Patients underwent concurrent pharmacokinetic modulation chemotherapy [5-FU administered by intravenous infusion: 600 mg/㎡ for 24 h, and tegafur-uracil (UFT) administered orally: 400 mg/㎡ for 5 days.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is an effective tool for local control that functions by inducing cancer cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell growth. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of caspase-cleaved keratin 18 cytoskeletal protein, M30, which is known as an apoptotic marker in residual rectal cancer following preoperative CRT. A total of 72 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone preoperative CRT were enrolled in this study. Immunostaining with M30 cytodeath antibody was performed and the correlation between M30 staining and clinicopathological variables was analyzed. Furthermore, we examined the correlation of M30 staining with the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Ki67 and PCNA using transcriptional and immunohistochemical analyses. The results showed that 34 (47%) patients were positive for M30 staining. Lack of M30 expression was significantly correlated with advanced T stage, postoperative stage and tumor recurrence (P<0.05). Patients with M30 staining had better recurrence-free survival (RFS) than those without it (P=0.0301). In the immunohistochemical analysis, residual cancer cells with M30 staining lacked Ki67 expression. No significant correlation was observed between M30 positivity and the gene expression of apoptotic and proliferative markers. In conclusion, findings of the present study suggested that the evaluation of M30 expression may be useful in the prediction of tumor recurrence in rectal cancer patients who have been treated with preoperative CRT.

258	Prognostic significance of nm23-H1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2004	15296908	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15296908	Journal Article	\N	145	136	9	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	A specimen was considered positive if more than 20% of cancer cells were positively stained and negative if less than 20% were positively stained.	En bloc esophagectomy with locoregional lymph node dissection was performed for all of these patients. Irradiation was prescribed for 60 Gyr (10 Gyr/5 fractions per week), and concurrent chemotherapy was dispensed for two cycles, in the ﬁrst and sixth week of irradiation. A combination regimen of chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (20 mg/㎡ per day), 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) (600 mg/㎡ per day) and leucovorin (120 mg/㎡ per day) for 4 days. Those with tumor recurrence were treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and/or additional local irradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVES: Tumor recurrence and metastasis are major causes of treatment failure in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Recently, nm23, originally considered to be an anti-metastatic gene, has been reported to associate with various roles in different human cancers. We therefore investigated the clinical significance of nm23-H1 expression in ESCC. METHODS: Pathological sections were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal antibody that was specific to nm23-H1. Expression of positive nm23-H1 staining was further confirmed by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The relationship between nm23-H1 expression and clinicopathological variables was examined by statistical analysis. Except for 11 (7%) surgical morality, the remaining 145 patients entered the prognostic analysis. The cisplatin-based chemotherapy was established for the patients with tumor stages at or beyond IIb, or with tumor recurrence. Survival difference between groups was compared by log rank test. RESULTS: Immunohistochemically, nm23-H1 expression was detected in 39.3% (57/145) of the pathological sections. It was positively correlated with tumor stage (P = 0.002), evident lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.001) and tumor recurrence (P = 0.02). Survival of nm23-H1 positive group was statistically superior to nm23-H1 negative group (P < 0.0001) By multivariate survival analysis, tumor stage, the number of lymph node metastasis and expression of nm23-H1 were the independent prognostic factors for ESCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that nm23-H1 expression was associated with disease progression in ESCC. However, survival of nm23-H1 positive group was superior to nm23-H1 negative group. This paradoxical result could suppose that nm23-H1 expression might increase cisplatin chemosensitivity and hence improve survival. Screening for nm23-H1 expression in tumor cells may be a potential therapeutic strategy in ESCC patients.

For MKI67, the percentage of nuclear reactivity was evaluated as follows: less than 10% nuclear reactivity in tumor cells was scored as 1 (low proliferation); 10% or greater nuclear reactivity in tumor cells was scored as 2 (high proliferation). For TP53, less than 20% nuclear reactivity in tumor cells was scored as 1 (low TP53 expression) and 20% or greater nuclear reactivity was scored as 2 (high TP53 expression).	Treatment parameters included opposed lateral fields using beam energies ranging from 2 to 6 MeV, five fractions per week, without planned treatment breaks. Patients were treated with a median daily fraction of 200 cGy (range, 180-255 cGy) to a total median dose of 66 Gy (range, 49.5-79 Gy) over 47 days (range, 27-78 d).	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether a significant correlation exists between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and local relapse in a large cohort of patients with T1 to 2N0 laryngeal cancer treated with primary radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Clinical and molecular analyses were conducted on 123 patients with biopsy-proven T1 to 2N0 laryngeal cancer. Clinical prognostic factors included pretreatment hemoglobin, age, sex, race, T stage, tumor subsite, beam energy, biologically equivalent dose, therapy duration, and treatment date. Molecular prognostic factors included COX-2, p53, and Ki-67 expression. Expression levels were determined by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded tissues arrayed on tissue microarrays. Multivariate analysis was done with the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients have locally relapsed, for an actuarial 5-year local relapse-free rate of 70.4%. On multivariate analysis, positive COX-2 expression predicted local relapse after radiation therapy. The relative risk (RR) for local relapse with COX-2 positivity was 2.57 (95% CI, 1.21-5.47; P = .01). Other prognostic factors for local relapse included negative Ki-67 expression (RR = 5.72; 95% CI, 2.04-16.1; P < .001), T2 stage (RR = 2.98; 95% CI, 1.39-6.38; P = .005), and therapy duration greater than 43 days (RR = 6.04; 95% CI, 1.37-26.7; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Positive COX-2 expression predicts for local relapse in T1 to 2N0 larynx cancer in a multivariate model. This relationship may have potential therapeutic implications regarding the use of COX-2 inhibitors during radiation therapy for optimal outcome.	The Laryngoscope	T1: 84 patients, T2: 39 patients.
260	Overexpression of Bcl-2 in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx: a marker of radioresistance	English	2002	12115532	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12115532	Journal Article	\N	21	20	1	\N	61	[39.0,93.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Sections were graded as positive for the nuclear antigens CDKN1A, CDKN2A and ATM if more than 50% of tumour nuclei were positive. The same cut-off was used to grade the cytoplasmic antigens BAX and BCL2. For MKI67, staining in at least 20% of nuclei was taken to signify a tumour with a high proliferation rate.	None of the patients had received radiation therapy prior to the biopsies; subsequently each patient received radical external beam radiotherapy. All patients received the same radiotherapy regime: 60 ± 2 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks.	Radiotherapy	5	Squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx can be treated using radiotherapy or surgery, either alone or in combination. Radiotherapy is preferred for early-stage tumours, as it spares the larynx and therefore preserves speech and swallowing. Unfortunately, approximately 15% of tumours treated this way will prove to be radioresistant, as manifest by tumour recurrence within the original radiotherapy field over the ensuing 12 months. By causing extensive DNA damage, radiotherapy aims to induce apoptosis and tumour regression. Our hypothesis was that defects in the mechanisms that recognise DNA damage, induce cell cycle arrest or control apoptosis, either alone or in combination, may be responsible for radioresistance. We therefore undertook an immunohistochemic analysis of pretreatment biopsies of radioresistant (n = 8) and radiosensitive (n = 13) laryngeal tumours. To minimise the impact of confounding factors, strict inclusion criteria were observed; all tumours were of the glottic subsite and all recurrences developed within 12 months of radiotherapy at the site of the original tumour. The expression of key proteins involved in DNA damage recognition (p53), cell cycle arrest (ATM, p16 and p21/WAF1) and apoptosis (Bcl-2 and BAX) were studied. Ki-67 was also assessed as a marker of cell proliferation to exclude low mitotic rate as a cause of radioresistance. A statistically significant correlation was observed between overexpression of Bcl-2 and radioresistance (p = 0.003, Fisher's exact test). We hypothesise that overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 allows tumour cells with extensive radiation-induced DNA damage to continue proliferating; the absence of an appropriate apoptotic response manifests clinically as radioresistance.

391	Low thrombospondin 2 expression is predictive of low tumor regression after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer	English	2015	26807188	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26807188	Journal Article	\N	172	108	64	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Low expression of THBS2 was defined as having H-scores less than the median of all scored cases.	All of these patients received radiation therapy at a total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a 5-week period with a 24-h continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil concurrently before surgery. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy was performed for those with either positive nodal status or tumor status of T3 to T4 in the pre-treatment (Pre-Tx) or post-treatment (Post-Tx) status.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery is the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Several heparin-binding associated proteins have been reported to play a critical role in cancer progression. However, the clinical relevancies of such proteins and their associations with CCRT response in rectal cancer have not yet to be fully elucidated. METHODS: The analysis of a public transcriptome of rectal cancer indicated that thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) is a predictive factor for CCRT response. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate the expression of THBS2 in pretreatment biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients without distant metastasis. Furthermore, the relationships between THBS2 expression and various clinicopathological factors or survival were analyzed. RESULTS: Low expression of THBS2 was significantly associated with advanced pretreatment tumor (P<0.001) and nodal status (P=0.004), post-treatment tumor (P<0.001) and nodal status (P<0.001), increased vascular invasion (P=0.003), increased perineural invasion (P=0.023) and inferior tumor regression grade (P=0.015). In univariate analysis, low THBS2 expression predicted worse outcomes for disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival (all P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, low expression of THBS2 still served as a negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival (Hazard ratio=3.057, P=0.002) and metastasis-free survival (Hazard ratio=3.362, P=0.012). CONCLUSION: Low THBS2 expression was correlated with advanced disease status and low tumor regression after preoperative CCRT and that it acted as an independent negative prognostic factor in rectal cancer. THBS2 may represent a predictive biomarker for CCRT response in rectal cancer.	American Journal of Translational Research	T1-2: 81 patients, T3-4: 91 patients; N0: 125 patients, N1-2: 47 patients.
262	Expression of Cox-2 protein in radioresistant laryngeal cancer	English	2004	15111350	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15111350	Journal Article	\N	122	104	18	\N	63.5	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Sections were regarded as positive if >5% of the tumour cells stained. Sections with ≤5% of the tumour staining were considered negative.	Patients diagnosed with laryngeal carcinoma and treated with single modality radiotherapy with curative intent (either 55 Gy in 20 fractions or 60 Gy in 25 fractions) were identified from databases held in ENT departments in England.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is the principal modality used to treat early stage laryngeal cancer. Unfortunately treatment failures occur in 10-25% of patients. Subsequent salvage surgery is technically more difficult, with increased complication and failure rates. The ability to predict or prevent radioresistance would improve the poor survival associated with this disease. Cox-2 is an inducible enzyme involved with prostaglandin synthesis. We investigated a potential role for Cox-2 in predicting radioresistance in laryngeal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using immunohistochemical techniques we examined the expression of Cox-2 protein in 122 pre-treatment laryngeal biopsies. All tumours were treated with single modality radiotherapy (curative intent). The group comprised of 61 radioresistant and 61 radiosensitive tumours matched for T stage, laryngeal subsite, gender and smoking history. RESULTS: Cox-2 expression was detected in 41 of 61 (67%) biopsy samples from patients with radioresistant tumours and 25 of 61 (41%) radiosensitive tumours. Overexpression was significantly associated with radioresistant tumours (P = 0.004). Cox-2 has a 67% accuracy in predicting radiotherapy failure. CONCLUSION: Cox-2 may have prognostic value in predicting response to radiotherapy. Cox-2 inhibitors such as NS-398 have been shown to enhance the effects of radiotherapy. We suggest that their use may be beneficial in patients who are destined to fail radiotherapy.	Annals of Oncology	T1N0M0: 86 patients, T2N0M0: 36 patients.

All patients were treated through opposed lateral beams using either 60 Co balt or 4-MV X-rays. Total dose ranged from 60 to 70 Gy, with a median dose of 66 Gy, delivered as a continuous course, prescribed at the intersection of the two beams at midplane. Wedges were used for dose homogeneity when necessary. Dose per fraction ranged from 1.8 to 2.0 Gy, and total duration of radiation treatment ranged from 42 to 60 days. The dose fractionations used were 70.2 Gy in 39 fractions over 8 weeks or 60-66 Gy in 30-33 fractions over 6-6.5 weeks. Salvage surgery was done in 18 patients in the form of hemilaryngectomy or total laryngectomy.	Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To study the role of two possible prognostic factors, p53 and tumor bulk, and their interaction with other tumor and treatment variables in early-stage laryngeal cancer patients treated with curative radiotherapy. METHODS: One hundred two patients with T1N0M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx treated with definitive radiotherapy were analyzed. p53 status in pretreatment biopsy specimens was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using mouse monoclonal antibody DO-7. Tumors were classified as small surface lesions or bulky tumors. All tumor-related and treatment-related variables which might influence the outcome were analyzed. Local control after definitive radiotherapy was the end point of the study. RESULTS: The local control at 5 years for the entire group of patients was 78% (80/102) and 91% (93/102) after surgical salvage. p53 overexpression by IHC was seen in 37% (38/102) of patients. Tumors were classified as small volume in 69 (68%) and bulky in 33 (32%) patients. Five-year local control was 48% for p53-positive patients as compared to 94% for p53-negative patients (p = 0.0001). Tumor bulk was the other important prognostic factor, with 5-year local control of 91% for small tumors and 48% for bulky tumors (p = 0.0001). Patients who had both p53 positivity and bulky tumors did worse, with a 5-year local control of 23% as compared to 92% for all other groups combined (p = 0.0001). Among other variables, only the length of radiation time was of borderline significance. CONCLUSION: Both p53 overexpression and tumor bulk are independent prognostic factors for local control in early-stage glottic cancer treated with curative radiotherapy. The precise relationship between a genetic event, the p53 mutation, and an observable phenotype expression such as tumor bulk needs to be further defined.

264	P53 and Ki-67 as outcome predictors for advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy	English	2001	11801963	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11801963	Journal Article	White; African American	105	79	26	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	On the basis of this analysis, nuclear staining was defined as positive for TP53 (TP53+) when more than 2% of the tumor cells were stained and positive for MKI67 (MKI67+) when any of the tumor cells were stained.	The chemotherapy regimen consisted of a combination of 4-day intravenous infusions of 1000 mg/㎡ 5-fluorouracil per day and 20 mg/㎡ cisplatin per day during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy. Radiotherapy was delivered 5 days a week using single daily fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy. Opposed lateral fields were, in general, used with an electron beam boost to selected nodal regions, as indicated. After approximately 50 to 55 Gy, patients were reevaluated. Patients with an obvious clinical response completed radiation to a total dose of between 66 and 72 Gy. In nonresponders, radiation was discontinued and, after a 3- to 6-week recovery period, surgery was performed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	HYPOTHESIS: P53 and Ki-67 status will predict response to treatment, organ preservation, and survival in patients with advanced squamous cell cancers of the head and neck treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of p53 and Ki-67 status from the CRT arm of a randomized, controlled trial (n = 50) and from patients receiving the same treatment but not enrolled in the trial (n = 55). METHODS: P53 and Ki-67 status were established from archived tissue samples using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Tumors were positive for p53 (p53+) when more than 2% of cells stained for p53 and were positive for Ki-67 (Ki-67+) when any cell stained for Ki-67. End points were tumor response, tumor recurrence, survival status, and organ preservation at last follow-up, and time to events. Predictive models were calculated for each outcome. RESULTS: Neither marker predicted tumor response to treatment. P53+ status was associated with tumor recurrence (P =.003) and locoregional recurrence (P =.003). Adjusting for time to event, p53+ status was significantly related to a lower recurrence-free survival (P =.004), lower disease-specific survival (P =.04), lower overall survival with primary site preservation (P =.03), and lower disease-specific survival with primary site preservation (P =.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that p53+ status was significantly related to a lower recurrence-free survival (P =.01, risk ratio [RR] = 3.65) and lower disease-specific survival with organ preservation (P =.02, RR = 3.41). Ki-67+ status was not related to any variables. However, multivariate analysis revealed that Ki-67+ was significantly related to a lower overall survival (P =.05, RR = 2.03). The combination of both markers negative (p53-/Ki-67-) was associated with a lower incidence of tumor recurrence (P =.02), lower locoregional recurrence (P =.01), and fewer second primary lesions (P =.04). Adjusting for time to event, p53-/Ki-67- status was significantly related to a higher recurrence-free survival (P =.02), higher disease-specific survival with primary site preservation (P =.02), and higher overall survival with primary site preservation (P =.02). Multivariate analysis revealed that p53-/Ki-67- status was significantly related to a higher overall survival with site preservation (P =.01, RR = 2.78). CONCLUSIONS: P53 and Ki-67 status appear to be related to the various survival end points considered in this study. However, this relation does not seem to be sufficient to warrant treatment modifications. Closer follow-up may be justified in both p53+ and Ki67+ patients to detect recurrence or a second primary at an earlier stage, possibly improving survival.

Of the 34 patients, 11 received preoperative chemoradiotherapy, 20 deﬁnitive chemoradiotherapy, and 3 RT (radiotherapy) alone. RT was usually delivered to the esophagus, mediastinum, and supraclavicular regions with opposite AP and PA ports of 6- or 10-MV X-rays. The dose per fraction ranged from 1.8 to 2.0 Gy. The tumor doses ranged from 39.6 to 40 Gy for preoperative RT and from 60 to 70 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment. In the deﬁnitive RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy, the treatment ﬁelds were reduced to the primary tumor and enlarged lymph nodes after a total dose of 40 Gy. Twenty-six patients received combination chemotherapy of cisplatinum and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5 d/wk), three received cisplatinum, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and leucovorin (5 d/wk), and two received cisplatinum alone (5 d/wk). The daily doses of the agents were as follows: cisplatinum 5-10 mg/㎡, 5-ﬂu- orouracil 250-500 mg/㎡, and leucovorin 10-30 mg/㎡, for a maximum of 4 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Esophageal carcinoma is a challenging target for radiotherapy. To improve treatment efficacy, an investigation of a predictive factor is desirable. In this study, we evaluated the significance of apoptosis and immunohistochemical staining for p53, Ki-67, c-erbB-2 (HER-2/neu), Ku (p70/p80), and DNA-PKcs for predictive markers of the responsiveness to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis consisted of 34 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in whom tumor biopsy was performed before treatment. They were divided into chemoradiosensitive (n = 13) and chemoradioresistant (n = 21) groups according to the tumor response evaluated at a total radiation dose of 40 Gy. The biopsy samples were examined with immunohistochemical staining for various factors and with an in situ nick end labeling method for apoptosis. The examined data were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The difference in the Ki-67, p53, Ku (p70/p80), DNA-PKcs labeling indexes and the apoptosis index in tumor cells between the chemoradiosensitive and chemoradioresistant groups was not statistically significant. The expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein was statistically significant in the chemoradioresistant group (p = 0.02), although it did not correlate with survival. CONCLUSIONS: c-erbB-2 immunostaining is useful for the prediction of chemoradioresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

266	Tribbles homolog 3 denotes a poor prognosis in breast cancer and is involved in hypoxia response	English	2011	21864376	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21864376	Journal Article	\N	179	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Postoperative radiotherapy to the breast after an incomplete resection or after breast-conserving treatment, or parasternal radiotherapy when the tumor was medially localized, had been administered to 179 patients.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia in solid tumors is associated with treatment resistance, resulting in poor prognosis. Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) is induced during hypoxia and is involved in multiple cellular pathways involved in cell survival. Here, we investigated the role of TRIB3 in breast cancer. METHODS: TRIB3 mRNA expression was measured in breast tumor tissue from 247 patients and correlated with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome. Furthermore, we studied TRIB3 expression regulation in cell lines, xenografts tissues and human breast cancer material using Reverse transcriptase, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemical staining. Finally, the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated TRIB3 knockdown on hypoxia tolerance was assessed. RESULTS: Breast cancer patients with low, intermediate or high TRIB3 expression exhibited a mean disease free survival (DFS) of 80 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 74 to 86), 74 (CI = 67 to 81), and 63 (CI = 55 to 71) months respectively (P = .002, Mantel-Cox log-rank). The prognostic value of TRIB3 was limited to those patients that had received radiotherapy as part of their primary treatment (n = 179, P = .005) and remained statistically significant after correction for other clinicopathological parameters (DFS, Hazard Ratio = 1.90, CI = 1.17 to 3.08, P = .009). In breast cell lines TRIB3 expression was induced by hypoxia, nutrient starvation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in an hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) independent manner. TRIB3 induction after hypoxia did not increase with decreasing oxygen levels. In breast tumor xenografts and human breast cancer tissues TRIB3 co-localized with the hypoxic cell marker pimonidazole. The induction of TRIB3 by hypoxia was shown to be regulated via the PERK/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the unfolded protein response and knockdown of TRIB3 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hypoxia sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: TRIB3 is independently associated with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, possibly through its association with tumor cell hypoxia.	Breast Cancer Research	\N

This was combined with four cycles of cisplatin at a dose of 25 mg/㎡ per day (total: 100 mg/㎡) or three cycles of 3 mg/㎡ per day, 5 days/week (total: 45 mg/㎡), along with concomitant radiotherapy (daily dose, 1.8-2.0 Gy; total dose, 35-40 Gy). If invasion of surrounding organs by the T4 esophageal tumor was still evident, the irradiation was increased to 60 Gy. Surgery was performed approximately 4 weeks after the ﬁnal dose of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The prognosis for patients with locally advanced thoracic esophageal cancer is extremely unfavorable. We have been administering neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by esophagectomy to these patients and studying whether REG I expression in untreated endoscopic biopsy specimens is predictive of patient responsiveness to CRT and/or survival after treatment. METHODS: Between 1992 and 2003, 47 patients with T4 (direct invasion of adjacent organs) thoracic esophageal cancers were administered neoadjuvant CRT followed by esophagectomy. REG I expression was assessed in untreated endoscopic biopsy specimens and correlated with clinical and histological responses and survival in 37 patients who had also undergone curative surgery. RESULTS: Among the 37 cases that received CRT followed by surgery, the therapeutic response rate for neoadjuvant CRT was 68%, and a complete histological response in resected specimens from the primary lesion was achieved in 8 (22%) patients. These clinical and histological responses to neoadjuvant CRT did not significantly correlate with survival, however. By contrast, 9 patients were judged REG-positive based on analysis of their untreated endoscopic biopsy specimens, and their cumulative survival rate was significantly higher than that of the 28 REG-negative patients (P = 0.0073). Univariate analysis showed REG I expression to be a prognostic factor (P = 0.0386) that increased the risk of death 8.4-fold. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of REG I expression in untreated endoscopic biopsy specimens may provide a basis for new treatments of locally advanced thoracic squamous cell esophageal cancers.

268	Inverse prognostic impact of ErbB2 mRNA and protein expression level in tumors of soft tissue sarcoma patients	English	2014	24715245	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715245	Journal Article	\N	27	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2) is overexpressed in a variety of human malignancies. Moreover, ErbB2 has been reported to influence cancer patient survival and progression of different tumor entities. However, information regarding the prognostic impact of ErbB2 in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients is limited and conflicting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: ErbB2 mRNA and protein levels were defined by quantitative real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the prognostic impact of ErbB2 mRNA and protein levels in tumor tissue of 124 soft tissue sarcoma patients were investigated. RESULTS: The median ErbB2 mRNA expression level in tumor tissue was decreased 3.9-fold compared to non-neoplastic surrounding tissue (p = 0.001). Furthermore, an increased ErbB2 mRNA expression level was associated with an improved tumor-specific survival (p = 0.01, log rank test). Multivariate Cox's proportional hazard regression analyses revealed an increased ErbB2 mRNA expression level as an independent favorable prognostic factor for tumor-specific survival of STS patients (n = 124; RR = 3.0; 95 % CI = 1.6-5.7; p < 0.001). In addition, multivariate Cox's proportional hazard regression analyses showed that an increased ErbB2 protein expression level correlated with poorer recurrence-free survival of STS patients (n = 47; RR = 9.9; 95 % CI = 1.7-59.7; p = 0.012), in particular for STS patients who received postoperative radiotherapy (n = 27; RR = 17.9; 95 % CI = 1.3-247.7; p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: This study suggests an inverse prognostic value of ErbB2 mRNA and protein expression level.

269	FADD expression as a prognosticator in early-stage glottic squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated primarily with radiotherapy	English	2012	22208968	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208968	Journal Article	\N	92	82	10	65	\N	[40.0,86.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Cutoff values of percentages for dichotomization for phosphorylation FADD were determined by use of receiver operating curve analyses, and the best sensitivity/specificity ratio associated with LC was found at a cutoff level of 71%. Percentages of positive staining above the cutoff level were considered as high expression and those below as negative/low expression.	T1 tumors were treated with a total dose of 66 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 times per week. T2 tumors were generally treated with 6 fractions per week, to a total dose of 70 Gy in 6 weeks. In case of elective irradiation of the neck nodes, a total dose of 46 Gy was given on the primary planning target volume with an additional boost of 70 Gy on the primary tumor and pathologic lymph nodes. Twenty-one patients in whom a local recurrence developed after radiotherapy underwent salvage by total laryngectomy; one patient received palliative therapy because of inoperable recurrent tumor.	Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: We recently reported on the identification of the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) as a possible driver of the chromosome 11q13 amplicon and the association between increased FADD expression and disease-specific survival in advanced-stage laryngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to examine whether expression of FADD and its Ser194-phosphorylated isoform (pFADD) predicts local control in patients with early-stage glottic carcinoma primarily treated with radiotherapy only. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immunohistochemical staining for FADD and pFADD was performed on pretreatment biopsy specimens of 92 patients with T1-T2 glottic squamous cell carcinoma primarily treated with radiotherapy between 1996 and 2005. Cox regression analysis was used to correlate expression levels with local control. RESULTS: High levels of pFADD were associated with significantly better local control (hazard ratio, 2.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-5.55; p = 0.040). FADD overexpression showed a trend toward better local control (hazard ratio, 3.656; 95% confidence interval, 0.853-15.663; p = 0.081). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that high pFADD expression was the best predictor of local control after radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that expression of phosphorylated FADD is a new prognostic biomarker for better local control after radiotherapy in patients with early-stage glottic carcinomas.

270	Prognostic significance of HIF-1a, CA-IX, and OPN in T1-T2 laryngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy	English	2013	24167820	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24167820	Journal Article	\N	60	43	17	62	\N	[33.0,96.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For evaluation of HIF1A, CA9, and SPP1, we used cutoff values of 0.5%, 12.5%, and 0.5% stained tumor cells, respectively.	All patients included in this study were primarily treated with RT (radiotherapy) only. RT was administered using megavoltage equipment (6 MV photons) and thermoplastic masks. In T1-T2aN0 cases, clinical target volume generally consisted of the gross tumor volume with 1-cm margins. In case of direct simulation, the field borders were set at the lower edge of the hyoid bone and the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. These patients were treated with two opposing lateral fields with a median fraction dose of 2.0Gy (5 times/week) up to 66 Gy to 70Gy in 7 weeks. In the other T2 cases, or in case of T1-T2/N+, the initial clinical target volume consisted of the primary tumor, the pathological lymph nodes plus 1-cm margins, and bilateral elective nodal areas. The boost volume consisted of the tumor and positive lymph nodes with 0.5-cm margins. For the planning target volume (PTV), 0.5-cm margins were applied. In general, patients were treated using two opposing lateral fields for the upper neck nodes and the primary site. PTV1 was treated with a total dose of 46Gy, followed by a boost dose of 24Gy to the primary tumor and pathological lymph nodes. Most patients were treated with conventional fractionation; however, fro㎡000, patients were generally treated with 6 fractions/week, with a second fraction on Friday afternoon with a minimum interval of 6 hours, up to 70Gy in 6 weeks.	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To examine the prognostic value of hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1a, CA-IX, and OPN on clinical outcome in patients with T1-T2 supraglottic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) treated with primarily radiotherapy (RT). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Tumor tissue sections of 60 patients with T1-T2 supraglottic LSCC treated with primarily radiotherapy were assessed immunohistochemically for expression of HIF-1a, CA-IX, and OPN. The relationship of protein expression and classical clinical parameters with clinical outcome was studied, using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. RESULTS: Neither HIF-1a nor CA-IX was of prognostic significance toward local control or overall survival in T1-T2 supraglottic LSCC. Cox regression survival analysis showed no relation between HIF-1a or CA-IX expression and local control (HR [hazard ratio] 1.07, CI [95% confidence interval] 0.29-3.87; HR 0.34, CI 0.04-2.58). Furthermore, OPN expression was not associated with local control (HR 1.37, CI 0.45-4.17) and overall survival (HR 0.99, CI 0.44-2.21). Our earlier findings in T1-T2 glottic LSCC (Schrijvers et al., 2008) could not be confirmed. CONCLUSION: The absence of prognostic significance for HIF-1a and CA-IX toward local control in supraglottic LSCC, unlike glottic LSCC, suggests that supraglottic LSCC might represent another biological entity.

For HIF1A, the best sensitivity/specificity ratio was found at a cutoff percentage of 0.5%. For CA9, it was 12.5% and for SLC2A1, 35%.	Radiotherapy (RT) was delivered using megavoltage equipment (6-MV linear accelerator). In patients with Stage T1 and T2 disease and normal vocal cord mobility, the target volume encompassed the gross tumor volume with margins of at least 1 cm for the clinical target volume (CTV) of the primary field. In the case of Stage T2N0 disease with impaired vocal cord mobility, the CTV also encompassed the elective nodal levels (II-IV) on both sides. In the case of node-positive disease, the CTV was extended to Level Ib-V of the involved neck. The CTV of the boost encompassed the gross tumor volume with at least a 0.5-cm margin. The planning target volume included the CTV plus a 0.5-cm margin. Generally, these target volumes were irradiated using two opposing lateral fields. In the case of primary RT for Stage T1 tumors, the total dose was 66 Gy, using 2-Gy fractions, five times weekly. Stage T2 tumors were generally treated with six fractions weekly, with a second fraction on Friday afternoon and a minimal interval of 6 h,toatotaldose of 70 Gy within 6 weeks. In the case of elective RT to the neck nodes, a total dose of 46 Gy was given to the primary planning target volume, with an additional boost of 70 Gy to the primary tumor and pathologic lymph nodes. Most patients who developed local recurrence after RT were salvaged with total laryngectomy.	Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To examine the prognostic value of three endogenous hypoxia markers (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit [HIF1 alpha], carbonic anhydrase IX [CA-IX], and glucose transporter type 1 [GLUT-1]) on the clinical outcome in patients with early-stage glottic carcinoma primarily treated with radiotherapy (RT) and to determine the predictive hypoxic profile to choose the optimal treatment of early-stage laryngeal carcinoma. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immunohistochemistry for HIF1 alpha, CA-IX, and GLUT-1 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, pretreatment tissue samples of 91 glottic squamous cell carcinoma specimens. The patient group consisted only of those with early-stage (T1-T2) glottic carcinoma, and all patients were treated with RT only. Relative tumor staining was scored on the tissue samples. Receiver operating curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cutoff value for each tumor marker. Cox regression analyses for the variables HIF1 alpha, CA-IX, GLUT-1, gender, age, hemoglobin level, T category, N category, tobacco use, and alcohol use were performed with local control and overall survival as endpoints. RESULTS: HIF1 alpha overexpression in early-stage glottic carcinoma correlated significantly with worse local control (hazard ratio [HR], 3.05; p = 0.021) and overall survival (HR, 2.92; p = 0.016). CA-IX overexpression correlated significantly with worse local control (HR, 2.93; p = 0.020). GLUT-1 overexpression did not show any correlation with the clinical outcome parameters. Tumors with a nonhypoxic profile (defined as low HIF1 alpha and low CA-IX expression) had significantly better local control (HR, 6.32; p = 0.013). CONCLUSION: The results of our study have shown that early-stage glottic laryngeal carcinomas with low HIF1 alpha and CA-IX expression are highly curable with RT. For this group, RT is a good treatment option. For tumors with HIF1 alpha or CA-IX overexpression, hypoxic modification before RT or primary surgical treatment should be considered.

272	Predicting the effect of accelerated fractionation in postoperative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer based on molecular marker profiles: data from a randomized clinical trial.	English	2010	19733016	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19733016	Journal Article	\N	148	133	15	57	\N	[36.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Patients were stratified according to the primary cancer site (larynx vs. other) and the treating cancer center (Gliwice vs. Bydgoszcz) and randomized to receive 63 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy, given either as a 5-day-per-week regimen (140 patients received postoperative conventional fractionation) or as a 7-day-per-week regimen (139 patients received postoperative continuous accelerated irradiation).	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic and predictive values of molecular marker expression profiles based on data from a randomized clinical trial of postoperative conventional fractionation (p-CF) therapy versus 7-day-per-week postoperative continuous accelerated irradiation (p-CAIR) therapy for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tumor samples from 148 patients (72 p-CF and 76 p-CAIR patients) were available for molecular studies. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess levels of EGFR, nm23, Ki-67, p-53, and cyclin D1 expression. To evaluate the effect of fractionation relative to the expression profiles, data for locoregional tumor control (LRC) were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Survival curves were compared using the Cox f test. RESULTS: Patients who had tumors with low Ki-67, low p-53, and high EGFR expression levels and oral cavity/oropharyngeal primary cancer sites tended to benefit from p-CAIR. A joint score for the gain in LRC from p-CAIR based of these features was used to separate the patients into two groups: those who benefited significantly from p-CAIR with respect to LRC (n = 49 patients; 5-year LRC of 28% vs. 68%; p = 0.01) and those who did not benefit from p-CAIR (n = 99 patients; 5-year LRC of 72% vs. 66%; p = 0.38). The nm23 expression level appeared useful as a prognostic factor but not as a predictor of fractionation effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the studies that demonstrate the potential of molecular profiles to predict the benefit from accelerated radiotherapy. The molecular profile that favored accelerated treatment (low Ki-67, low p-53, and high EGFR expression) was in a good accordance with results provided by other investigators. Combining individual predictors in a joint score may improve their predictive potential.

All patients were treated with primary radiotherapy: Two hundred forty-six patients (81%) received external radiotherapy alone, and 58 patients (19%) received external radiotherapy plus a boost of brachytherapy (usually for T3-T4 lesions). The total dose of radiation was higher for patients with advanced T classification tumors (P = 0.001; ANOVA). The mean total doses and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for patients with T1-T4 tumors, respectively, were as follows: 61 Gy (95% CI, 59-63 Gy), 64 Gy (95% CI, 62-65 Gy), 67 Gy (95% CI, 65-70 Gy), and 64 Gy (95% CI, 61-66 Gy). The total dose was often adjusted in accordance with the response of the tumor. The dose per fraction was 2 Gy. None of the patients was treated with chemotherapy, radiochemotherapy, or surgery for the primary tumor. Thirty-six patients (11%) underwent cervical dissection as part of their initial management: 24 patients in association with external radiotherapy and brachytherapy and 12 patients with external radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: p53 and Ki-67 are regarded as potential interesting predictors of radioresistance, although their exact influence awaits confirmation on a large cohort of uniformly treated patients. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 304 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with radical radiotherapy, the expression levels of p53 and Ki-67 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Local control and survival curves were generated for p53 and Ki-67 using the Kaplan-Meier method. The difference between curves was calculated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: The overexpression of p53 was associated with local treatment failure (P = 0.01) but not with survival (P = 0.09). In a Cox analysis, p53 overexpression remained an independent predictor of local failure, with a relative risk of local failure of 1.5 (P = 0.05). Low proliferation (Ki-67 < 20%) was a significant factor in local failure for patients with tumors of the oral cavity only (P = 0.01). Patients with both unfavorable immunohistochemical markers (p53 overexpression and low proliferation) had a 45% rate of local control compared with a 67% rate for all other combinations (P = 0.002). This association was even more significant in patients with T1-T2 lesions (45% vs. 77%; P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the role of p53 as an independent predictor of local failure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are treated by radical radiotherapy, suggesting that it may predict radioresistance. Combined with p53, Ki-67 may help in the better selection of patients for radiotherapy, especially for patients with early-stage tumors. Prospective studies are now needed to confirm these results and to define better the role of these markers in the management of patients with head and neck carcinoma.

274	Hypoxia inducible factor (HIf1alpha and HIF2alpha) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression and response of head-neck cancer to hypofractionated and accelerated radiotherapy	English	2008	17852557	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17852557	Journal Article	\N	39	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For HIF1A and EPAS1, a strong cytoplasmic expression in more than 50% of cancer cells or nuclear expression in more than 10% of cancer cells was considered positive. As in previous studies of head-neck carcinomas treated with radiotherapy, tissue samples with at least 10% of cancer cells reactive for CA9 were considered as being positive for CA9.	Radiotherapy was given using a 6/18 MV linear accelerator endowed with a multi-leaf collimator, after CT-simulation and conformal radiotherapy planning (Plato, Nucletron). Large daily fractionswere used (3.4 Gy) for a total of 15 fractions to deliver the whole planned dose within 26 days (insertion of a split of 1 week after the first two weeks of therapy). Supraclavicular areas were also irradiated through an anterior field, receiving 11 fractions of 3.4 Gy (equivalent to 46 Gy in 15 days). Involved node areas received a higher dose (12-15 fractions). Amifostine 500-1000 mg was diluted in 2.5-5 ml water for injection and was injected in two sites (usually the right and left shoulder), before each radiotherapy fraction. Patients received cisplatin (30 mg/㎡ per week) or oxaliplatin (60 mg/㎡ every two weeks) during radiotherapy. Chemotherapy with cisplatin (60 mg/㎡ every two weeks) and capecitabine (600 mg/㎡ twice-a-day, 5 days per week) per os followed for 3 months. 5 patients had surgery before radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia and low intrinsic radiosensitivity may counteract the efficacy of standard radiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). We investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with locally advanced HNC received 15 daily fractions of 3.4 Gy amounting to a total tumor dose of 51 Gy (equivalent to 63 Gy in four weeks--one week split); this was combined with platinum chemotherapy and amifostine cytoprotection administered subcutaneously. Immunohistochemical analysis of hypoxia-regulated proteins, namely HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9, was performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained prior to radio-chemotherapy. RESULTS: HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity. A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively. Complete response was obtained in 85.2% of patients and HIF1alpha was marginally related with persistent disease after RT (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha was significantly associated with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.008), whilst HIF2alpha was not. A significant association of CA9 expression with poor LRFS was noted (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation.

275	Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 overexpression is mostly independent of gene amplification and constitutes an independent prognosticator for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24771220	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24771220	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	48.6000000000000014	[20.0,83.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For statistical analysis, cases with H-scores no less than the median were determined to have high CDK4 expression, while those with H-scores less than the median were considered to have low expression.	All 124 cases accepted a complete course of radiotherapy (RT), total dose ≧7,000 cGy, and cisplatin-based chemotherapy was performed in those with stage II-IV disease. The method of RT was generally uniform over this period.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Data mining in the public domain demonstrates that cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC). Associated with cyclin-D, CDK4 phosphorylates and inactivates retinoblastoma (Rb) protein family members and mediates progression through the G1- to the S-phase of the cell cycle. Amplification and overexpression of CDK4 has been identified in various human malignancies. However, its expression and amplification has never been systemically evaluated in NPC. This study aimed to evaluate the amplification and expression status, correlation with clinicopathological features, and prognostic implications of CDK4 based on public domain dataset and in our well-defined cohort of NPC patients. The association between CDK4 transcript level and gene dosage was explored by analysis of an independent public domain dataset. We retrospectively assessed CDK4 immunoexpression in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients devoid of initial distant metastasis and treated according to consistent guidelines. The results were correlated with clinicopathological features, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMeFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS). High levels of CDK4 protein were positively correlated with the T 3, 4 status (p = 0.024); N 2, 3 status (p < 0.001); and the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3, 4 (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis suggested high CDK4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of worse DMeFS (p = 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.226) and DSS (p = 0.037, HR = 1.838). Although CDK4 is frequently upregulated, its gene locus is very uncommonly amplified in NPC. CDK4 overexpression is mostly independent with gene amplification and represents a potential prognostic biomarker in NPC and may indicate tumor aggressiveness through cell cycle dysregulation.

276	Improved survival in HPV/p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy	English	2015	25252603	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252603	Journal Article	\N	63	46	17	58	\N	[38.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For statistical analysis, samples were regarded as CDKN2A positive if at least 80 % of the cells (calculated as the sum of percentages) displayed a moderate (intensity = 2) and/or strong staining (intensity = 3).	103 patients were treated consecutively with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. All patients irradiated received standard fractionation rt, which consisted of the delivery of a total dose of 50-70 gy (at 2 Gy per fraction). Stage ii disease was treated with a total dose of 50 gy and stages iii or iV with a total dose of 60 Gy. in case of R1 or R2 resection, higher total doses of 66 or 70 Gy, respectively, were prescribed. the clinically high-risk target volume (corresponding to the gross tumor volume plus 8-10 mm margin) received the complete prescribed dose, while adjacent clinically uninvolved lymph-node regions were treated with a prescribed total dose of 50-60 gy, depending on the individual risk situation (e.g.,R1 versus R2 resection). in case of pT2 N0 R0 disease and after neck dissection, postoperative radiotherapy of the neck was not performed.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: In the literature, HPV infection and/or p16 positivity have been consistently demonstrated to correlate with improved response rates in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients treated with primary radiotherapy (RT) alone and in combination with chemotherapy. However, the exact role of HPV/p16 positivity in patients treated with postoperative RT is still unclear. METHODS: We analyzed tumor samples for HPV-DNA and p16 expression and correlated these variables with treatment outcome in a series of 63 consecutively treated oropharyngeal cancer patients (95% stage III/IV). HPV and p16 analysis were performed using validated test systems. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to compare the risk of death among patients stratified according to risk factors. RESULTS: Expression of p16 or high-risk HPV-DNA was detected in 60.3% and 39.6% of the tumors, respectively. p16 expression [overall survival (OS) at 2 years: 91%] as well as HPV infection (OS at 2 years: 95%) was associated with improved OS. Mean survival in p16-positive patients was 112 months compared to 64.6 months in case of p16 negativity. All HPV-positive tumors stained positive for p16. In a multivariable analysis, p16 positivity was associated with improved OS and with disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: p16 expression and HPV infection are strongly associated with the outcome of postoperatively irradiated OPSCC patients. HPV and p16 double-negative OPSCC patients should be regarded as a distinct "very high-risk patient group" that may benefit from intensified or novel treatment combinations.

277	c-Met expression is a marker of poor prognosis in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiation	English	2014	24521684	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24521684	Journal Article	\N	107	17	90	62	\N	[42.0,85.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The intensity of all immunohistochemical stains was scored with a 4-tier system (0=absent, 1=weak, 2=intermediate, and 3=intense); scores were averaged for duplicate cores. Positive CDKN2A expresion was defined as diffuse 3+ staining (all 3+ cases were 50% or greater) or 1+ and/or 2+ staining in 50% or more of tumor cells. Positive EGFR expression was defined as membranous staining with any amount of 3+ staining (all 3+ cases were 50% or greater) or 1+ and/or 2+ staining in 50% or more of tumor cells. High MET expression was defined as an average intensity value of 2.5 or higher.	All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with their radiation treatments. Chemotherapy was given at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist, and concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (n=70), carboplatin (n=13), or cetuximab (n=24). Eighteen percent (n=19) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. All patients received intensity modulated radiation therapy with a simultaneous integrated boost technique with the dose prescribed to 2 planning target volumes. A dose of 70 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction was typically prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV1) encompassing the gross tumor volume, and 59.85 Gy at 1.71 Gy per fraction was prescribed to the planning target volume (PTV2) encompassing the uninvolved clinical target volume.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To examine the prognostic significance of c-Met expression in relation to p16 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Archival tissue from 107 HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation was retrieved, and a tissue microarray was assembled. Immunohistochemical staining of c-Met, p16, and EGFR was performed. c-Met expression was correlated with p16, EGFR, clinical characteristics, and clinical endpoints including locoregional control (LRC), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients were positive for p16, and 53% were positive for EGFR. Both p16-negative (P≤.001) and EGFR-positive (P=.019) status predicted for worse DFS. Ninety-three percent of patients stained positive for c-Met. Patients were divided into low (0, 1, or 2+ intensity) or high (3+ intensity) c-Met expression. On univariate analysis, high c-Met expression predicted for worse LRC (hazard ratio [HR] 2.27; 95% CI, 1.08-4.77; P=.031), DM (HR 4.41; 95% CI, 1.56-12.45; P=.005), DFS (HR 3.00; 95% CI, 1.68-5.38; P<.001), and OS (HR 4.35; 95% CI, 2.13-8.88; P<.001). On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for site, T stage, smoking history, and EGFR status, only high c-Met expression (P=.011) and negative p16 status (P=.003) predicted for worse DFS. High c-Met expression was predictive of worse DFS in both EGFR-positive (P=.032) and -negative (P=.008) patients. In the p16-negative patients, those with high c-Met expression had worse DFS (P=.036) than did those with low c-Met expression. c-Met expression was not associated with any outcome in the p16-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: c-Met is expressed in the majority of locally advanced HNSCC cases, and high c-Met expression predicts for worse clinical outcomes. High c-Met expression predicted for worse DFS in p16-negative patients but not in p16-positive patients. c-Met predicted for worse outcome regardless of EGFR status.

278	The gene expression profile of inflammatory, hypoxic and metabolic genes predicts the metastatic spread of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2014	24387976	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24387976	Journal Article	\N	61	52	9	57	\N	[42.0,82.0)	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVES: To assess the prognostic value of the expression profile of the main genes implicated in hypoxia, glucose and lactate metabolism, inflammation, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix interactions for the metastatic spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a high-throughput qRT-PCR, we performed an unsupervised clustering analysis based on the expression of 42 genes for 61 patients. Usual prognostic factors and clustering analysis results were related to metastasis free survival. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 48months, 19 patients died from a metastatic evolution of their head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and one from a local recurrence. The unsupervised clustering analysis distinguished two groups of genes that were related to metastatic evolution. A capsular rupture (p=0.005) and the "cluster CXCL12 low" (p=0.002) were found to be independent prognostic factors for metastasis free survival. Using a Linear Predictive Score methodology, we established a 9-gene model (VHL, PTGER4, HK1, SLC16A4, DLL4, CXCL12, CXCR4, PTGER3 and CA9) that was capable of classifying the samples into the 2 clusters with 90% accuracy. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, our clustering analysis underlined the independent prognostic value of the expression of a panel of genes involved in hypoxia and tumor environment. It allowed us to define a 9-gene model which can be applied routinely to classify newly diagnosed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. If confirmed by an independent prospective study, this approach may help future clinical management of these aggressive tumors.

279	The prognostic value of the hypoxia markers CA IX and GLUT 1 and the cytokines VEGF and IL 6in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated by radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy	English	2005	15847702	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847702	Journal Article	\N	34	31	3	\N	58	[42.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with radiotherapy ± chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Several parameters of the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia, inflammation and angiogenesis, play a critical role in tumor aggressiveness and treatment response. A major question remains if these markers can be used to stratify patients to certain treatment protocols. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inter-relationship and the prognostic significance of several biological and clinicopathological parameters in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated by radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. METHODS: We used two subgroups of a retrospective series for which CT-determined tumoral perfusion correlated with local control. In the first subgroup (n = 67), immunohistochemistry for carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) and glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) was performed on the pretreatment tumor biopsy. In the second subgroup (n = 34), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine pretreatment levels of the cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum. Correlation was investigated between tumoral perfusion and each of these biological markers, as well as between the markers mutually. The prognostic value of these microenvironmental parameters was also evaluated. RESULTS: For CA IX and GLUT-1, the combined assessment of patients with both markers expressed above the median showed an independent correlation with local control (p = 0.02) and disease-free survival (p = 0.04) with a trend for regional control (p = 0.06). In the second subgroup, IL-6 pretreatment serum level above the median was the only independent predictor of local control (p = 0.009), disease-free survival (p = 0.02) and overall survival (p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, we are the first to report a link in HNSCC between IL-6 pretreatment serum levels and radioresistance in vivo. This link is supported by the strong prognostic association of pretreatment IL-6 with local control, known to be the most important parameter to judge radiotherapy responses. Furthermore, the combined assessment of CA IX and GLUT-1 correlated independently with prognosis. This is a valuable indication that a combined approach is important in the investigation of prognostic markers.

The methods of the radiotherapy and radical cystectomy have been previously detailed. Briefly, the majority received 50 Gy in 25 fractions using a four-field technique with high energy photons (≥18MV).	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) is a key regulator of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint and has been implicated as having a role in G1 arrest and apoptosis induced by radiation damage. In this report we examine the association between pRB expression and radiation response in patients treated between 1960 and 1983 with preoperative radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) followed 4-6 weeks later by radical cystectomy. The correlation of pRB to patient outcome and how this relationship is complimentary to that seen with p53 staining status is also described. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immunohistochemical staining of pRB and p53 in paraffin-embedded tumor sections using WL-1 anti-RB and DO1 anti-p53 antibodies was considered adequate in 98 and 97 pretreatment tumor samples, respectively. There were 46 patients with clinical Stage T2, 28 with Stage T3a, and 24 with Stage T3b disease. The median age was 62 years and follow-up for those living was 85 months. RESULTS: Staining for pRB was negative in 30% of the cases. Correlations were observed between pRB negativity and high pretreatment apoptosis level (p = 0.06), locally advanced clinical stage (p = 0.01), increased clinical-to-pathologic downstaging (p = 0.014), and more pathologic complete responses (Path-CRs; p = 0.019). Several other factors were tested and were not associated with pRB status, including p53 expression. RB status was the only pretreatment prognostic factor in the univariate analyses that correlated with downstaging and was independently associated with Path-CR using multivariate logistic regression. Despite these significant relationships, no correlations with patient outcome were observed when the entire cohort was analyzed. Restriction of the analyses to Stage T3b patients, however, revealed that pRB negativity predicted for enhanced distant metastasis freedom (p = 0.006, log rank) and overall survival (p = 0.02). The overexpression of p53 also correlated with distant metastasis freedom and overall survival in Stage T3b patients. Patient outcome was best when RB negative and p53 negative staining were seen. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that loss of RB function as measured by immunohistochemical staining is the strongest correlate of radiation response thus far recognized. Loss of RB expression also predicted for poor outcome in Stage T3b patients, which appeared to compliment the finding of normal p53 expression. While normal RB protein expression is usually associated with better patient outcome, other series have not examined patients treated with radiotherapy. The absence of pRB may be a useful marker for selecting patients for bladder preservation with radiotherapy, particularly when wild-type p53 is present.

The Allred score was derived from the percentage of XRCC1staining tumor cells and staining intensity. Using the median Allred score as the cutoff, XRCC1 expression status was dichotomized into high and low expression. Tumor CDKN2A expression was dichotomized as CDKN2A positive (strong nuclear or cytoplasmic staining in 70% or more tumor cells) or CDKN2A negative.	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: We evaluated X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1) protein in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in association with outcome. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: XRCC1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of pretreatment tissue samples in 138 consecutive HNSCC patients treated with surgery (n = 31), radiation (15), surgery and radiation (23), surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation (17), primary chemoradiation (51), and palliative measures (1). RESULTS: Patients with high XRCC1 expression by IHC (n = 77) compared with patients with low XRCC1 expression (n = 60) had poorer median overall survival (OS; 41.0 months vs. OS not reached, P = 0.009) and poorer progression-free survival (28.0 months vs. 73.0 months, P = 0.031). This association was primarily due to patients who received chemoradiation (median OS of high- and low-XRCC1 expression patients, 35.5 months and not reached respectively, HR 3.48; 95% CI: 1.44-8.38; P = 0.006). In patients treated with nonchemoradiation modalities, there was no survival difference by XRCC1 expression. In multivariable analysis, high XRCC1 expression and p16(INK4a)-positive status were independently associated with survival in the overall study population (HR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.52-4.52; P < 0.001 and HR = 0.21; 95% CI: 0.06-0.71; P = 0.012, respectively) and among chemoradiation patients (HR = 6.02; 95% CI: 2.36-15.37; P < 0.001 and HR = 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08-0.92, respectively; P = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS: In HNSCC, high XRCC1 protein expression is associated with poorer survival, particularly in patients receiving chemoradiation. Future validation of these findings may enable identification of HNSCC expressing patients who benefit from chemoradiation treatment.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

All patients received postoperative radiotherapy after macroscopically radical surgery. In the ﬁrst years of the study a total dose of 5000 cGy was given in daily fractions of 250 cGy four times weekly, speciﬁed on the isodose that covered the target area (presacral space). In the later years a dose of 4500 cGy was given in daily fractions of 225 cGy four times weekly, speciﬁed on the 95% isodose. After this a boost was usually given, covering the original tumor area only, up to a dose of 5400 to 5500 cGy (or up to 6000 cGy in some high-risk patients), with fractions of 225 or 250 cGy. Sixty-six patients underwent a low-anterior resection (LAR), 55 underwent an abdominal–perineal resection (APR) and in two patients a Hartmann procedure was performed.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To investigate whether p53 immunoreactivity is a prognostic factor for survival and pelvic control in rectal carcinoma treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1981 through 1989, 146 patients with rectal carcinoma received postoperative radiotherapy and were followed for at least 5 years or until death. The specimens of 123 of these 146 patients could be retrieved and examined immunohistochemically for p53 expression. The prognostic value for survival and pelvic control of p53 expression and other patient and treatment factors was examined by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: p53 expression has no prognostic significance for overall survival in this group of 123 patients. The only prognostic factor for survival in this material is tumor stage (p < 0.01). The actuarial pelvic recurrence rates of p53- and p53+ cases are different in favor of the p53- ones. In the univariate analysis this difference is significant (p = 0.05). However, in the multivariate analysis the influence of p53 expression, additional to stage, becomes nonsignificant (p = 0.10). This indicates that p53 expression is not a strong independent prognostic factor for pelvic recurrence. In the multivariate analysis stage turns out to be the only predictor of pelvic recurrence (p = 0.03). When only recurrences inside the radiation field are considered, there is no difference between p53+ and p53-cases. CONCLUSION: Based on this material, we have found no convincing evidence that p53 expression is an important predictor of survival or local control in rectal cancer treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. We have found no evidence that possible differences in radiosensitivity between p53+ and p53- tumors have clinical significance for this group of patients.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the extent and intensity of EGFR expression. All patients were treated by induction chemotherapy with two to three cycles of cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) and epirubicin 110 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks followed by radiotherapy. The median follow-up time was 52 months for all patients and 99 months for surviving patients. RESULTS: EGFR expression was present in 89% of cases. EGFR intensity was negative in 11%, weak in 43%, moderate in 13%, and strong in 33%. The EGFR extent was <5% in 15%, > or =5% but <25% in 13%, and > or =25% in 72%. No correlation was found between EGFR expression and T stage, N stage, stage group, nodal size, gender, and age. No statistically significant differences in chemotherapy response rates were found in patients with different EGFR intensity and extent. EGFR extent > or =25% was associated with a significantly poorer treatment outcome. The 5-year disease-specific survival, relapse-free survival, locoregional relapse-free, and distant metastasis-free rate in patients with EGFR extent > or =25% was 48%, 36%, 60%, and 55%, respectively. The corresponding rates in patients with EGFR extent <25% were 86%, 80%, 93%, and 86%. The differences were all statistically significant, except for distant metastasis. No statistically significant differences in relapse-free and disease-specific survival rates were found among patients with differing EGFR intensity. In multivariate analysis, EGFR extent was the only independent factor that predicted for disease relapse, locoregional failure, and cancer death. CONCLUSION: Our study results showed that EGFR expression was common in advanced stage NPC, and the expression did not correlate with tumor or nodal stage. Correlative analysis showed that EGFR extent was a strong, independent prognostic factor that determined locoregional control, relapse-free survival, and disease-specific survival in Stage III-IV NPC treated with induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Our findings suggest that EGFR expression status can identify a subgroup of patients within advanced stage disease that will have a poor outcome after induction chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Whether this patient subgroup will benefit from an alternate treatment strategy and anti-EGFR-targeted treatment requires additional studies.

444	Expression of DNA-PKcs and BRCA1 as prognostic indicators in nasopharyngeal carcinoma following intensity-modulated radiation therapy	English	2013	23599763	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23599763	Journal Article	\N	87	54	33	46	\N	[17.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	When ≥50% of the tumor cells in the biopsy specimen were immunopositive for PRKDC, the patient was classified in the PRKDC (+) groups, respectively. When <50% of tumor cells were immunopositive, including loss of expression, the patient was classified in the corresponding low expression group.	Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I-II were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) alone and those with stage III-IVB with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in cancer mainly involve double-strand breaks (DSBs) which are important in maintaining the stability of genes. The DNA repair genes breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) are capable of maintaining genetic stability through two distinct and complementary repair mechanisms for DNA DSBs, known as repair-homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). DNA-PKcs is a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family. The PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathway is implicated in cell migration and invasion. The BRCA1 protein is implicated in multiple complex cellular processes that are related to chromosome sensitivity to mutagens. To determine the protein expression and clinical implications of DNA-PKcs and BRCA1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and cancer progression, we evaluated its expression status by immunohistochemistry in 87 patients who received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). In NPC, negative expression of DNA-PKcs was detected in 35 of the 87 (40.2%) cancer types and was significantly associated with poor patient survival (P<0.05). The overexpression of DNA-PKcs and BRCA1 also led to significantly improved distant metastasis-free survival compared with patients who did not overexpress both genes, although the expression level of BRCA1 and distant metastasis-free survival were not closely correlated. In addition, multivariate analysis indicated that DNA-PKcs status is a predictive marker of distant metastasis-free survival. In conclusion, lower expression of DNA-PKcs may be correlated with higher distant metastasis in patients with NPC. DNA-PKcs may be a predictive marker of distant metastasis after IMRT, independent of the classical prognostic marker. BRCA1 may additionally exert a synergistic effect to predict distant metastasis-free survival.	Oncology Letters	Stage II: 14 patients, Stage III: 35 patients, Stage IVA-B: 38 patients.
284	The Relationships Between Cyclin D1 and PCNA Expres sions and Radiosensitivity of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma	Chinese	2003	\N	http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&id=zgzl200312019	Journal Article	\N	65	44	21	49	\N	[15.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	High: positive cells >25%.	\N	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationships between cyclin D1 and protiferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and radiosensitivity in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: Sixty-five patients with NPC treated with primary radiotherapy. Expression of cyclin D1 and PCNA in biopsy specimens were studied before radiotherapy by means of SP immunohistochemical staining. The expression of cyclin D1 and PCNA and radiosensitive were further analyzed by nuivariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Cyclin D1 positive rate was 60%, PCNA high-level expression rate was 52.3%. Radiosensitive tumor (CR) was observed in 40 cases (61.5), while radioresistant (PR+MR) in 25 cases (38.5%). CR rate of these tumors were significantly higher than those with cyclin D1 negative low level expression of PCNA (42.3%, 38.7%, respectively) (P<0.01). In each stage, there was significantly different in CR rates between groups of cyclin D1 positive, and negative groups and also between groups of high-expression and low-expression of PCNA (P<0.01). Logistic multivariate regression level of PCNA, clinical stage, tumor size, patient's age and gender in a descending order. CONCLUSION: NPC patients with high-expression of PCNA or/and cyclin D1 positive are more radiosensitive than those with low-level expression of PCNA or cyclin D1 negative. As a predictor of radiosensitivity, PCNA may have more applicant significance than cyclin D1. These biological markers could serve as a useful predictor to inidividualize therapy for NPC patients.

285	Inhibiting UHRF1 expression enhances radiosensitivity in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2013	23943380	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943380	Journal Article	\N	61	41	20	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Interpretation scores were as follows: 0 point, ≤5 % of positive cells or negative staining; 1 point, 5-25 % of positive cells or weak staining, 2 points, 25-50 % of positive cells or moderate staining; and 3 points, ≥50 % of positive cells or strong staining. The final score of UHRF1 expression was the outcome of UHRF1 expression rate and intensity, graded as - for 0 point, + for 1-2 points, ++ for 3-4 points, and +++ for 5-6 points. Immunoreactivity -/+ were categorized as low expression and ++/+++ as high expression for the statistical analyses.	Radiotherapy was administered in daily divided doses with 6MV-X linear accelerators, and all patients received mediastinum or neck irradiation with a total dose 50-70 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for some esophageal cancers, but the molecular mechanisms of radiosensitivity remain unknown. Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1 (UHRF1) is a novel nuclear protein which is overexpressed in various cancers but not yet examined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The correlation between UHRF1 and the radioresistance in ESCC is still unclear. In the present study, the expression of UHRF1 was examined by immunohistochemistry in specimens of ESCC patients treated with radiotherapy. The results showed that UHRF1 was significantly overexpressed in ESCC specimens. Overexpression of UHRF1 correlated significantly with advanced T-stage, positive lymph node metastasis and poor differentiation. In addition, UHRF1 was associated with radiotherapy response, in which overexpression of UHRF1 was observed more frequently in the radioresistant group than in the effective group. At the molecular level, inhibition of UHRF1 by lentivirus-mediated shRNA targeting UHRF1 increased the radiosensitivity and apoptosis, while decreased radiation-induced G2/M phase arrest in TE-1 cells. Moreover, inhibition of UHRF1 resulted in higher residual γH2AX expression after irradiation, but not initial γH2AX. Further study showed that inhibition of UHRF1 down-regulated the endogenous expressions of DNA repair protein Ku70 and Ku80 in TE-1 cells, and significantly inhibited the increase of these proteins after irradiation. Above all, our data suggested that UHRF1 might play an important role in radioresistance of ESCC, and inhibition of UHRF1 can increase the radiosensitivity of TE-1 cells by altering cell cycle progression, enhancing apoptosis, and decreasing DNA damage repair capacity.

Preoperative radiation therapy (36 Gy) followed by radical surgical resection with a safety margin of at least 1 cm. Preoperative total dose of 36 Gy was administered by bilateral opposing beams (1.3 MV photons), covering tumor site and bilateral draining lymphatics of the neck, including the supraclavicular region. The dose was given in fractions of 2 Gy/day through 5 days/week. When additional postoperative radiation was to be expected based on the initial clinical findings or the imaging results, spinal marrow was blocked after 30 Gy of preoperative therapy and bilateral opposing 10 MeV electron beams were attached to the dorsal margin of blocked photon beams. In cases of incomplete resection (positive resection margins on histopathologic examination), lymphangiosis carcinomatosa or extracapsular spread of involved nodes, additional postoperative radiotherapy was given up to a complete dose of 60 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy/day through 5 days/week.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	This study tested the hypothesis that GLUT-1 is a marker of radioresistance in oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). A GLUT-1 labeling index (LI) was determined by immunohistochemistry in 40 pretreatment OSCC biopsies. Radiation responses were categorized by histopathology of the resection specimens. Associations between the LI and radiation response, Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox regression analysis for the variables GLUT-1, T-stage, N-stage and chemotherapy were examined. The median LI was 64.2% (range 14-100%). Tumors with >65% of GLUT-1+cells were more resistant to radiation (p=0.023). Overall survival was higher (p=0.044) for subjects with low LI (<median value) than those with high LI (>median value). The Cox regression analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of GLUT-1. Our results indicate that pre-treatment GLUT-1 expression in the tumor is a marker of radioresistance in OSCC, with high expression being associated with poor radiation response and shorter survival.

287	Low ERCC1 mRNA and protein expression are associated with worse survival in cervical cancer patients treated with radiation alone	English	2010	20934765	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20934765	Journal Article	\N	112	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy was given as a combination of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy using the cesium Selectron (Nucletron, The Netherlands) unit. The most common external beam radiotherapy dose and fractionation schedule was 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. The most common LDR brachytherapy dose and fractionation was 40 Gy in 2 fractions, 1 week apart, starting 1 week after the completion of external beam radiotherapy. Mean total radiotherapy dose to Point A was 82 Gy. None of the patients were treated with primary surgery or with concurrent chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate the association of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) expression, using both mRNA and protein expression analysis, with clinical outcome in cervical cancer patients treated with radical radiation therapy (RT). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients (n=186) with locally advanced cervical cancer, treated with radical RT alone from a single institution were evaluated. Pre-treatment FFPE biopsy specimens were retrieved from 112 patients. ERCC1 mRNA level was determined by real-time PCR, and ERCC1 protein expression (FL297, 8F1) was measured using quantitative immunohistochemistry (AQUA®). The association of ERCC1 status with local response, 10-year disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. RESULTS: ERCC1 protein expression levels using both FL297 and 8F1 antibodies were determined for 112 patients; mRNA analysis was additionally performed in 32 patients. Clinical and outcome factors were comparable between the training and validation sets. Low ERCC1 mRNA expression status was associated with worse OS (17.9% vs 50.1%, p=0.046). ERCC1 protein expression using the FL297 antibody, but not the 8F1 antibody, was significantly associated with both OS (p=0.002) and DFS (p=0.010). After adjusting for pre-treatment hemoglobin in a multivariate analysis, ERCC1 FL297 expression status remained statistically significant for OS [HR 1.9 (1.1-3.3), p=0.031]. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment tumoral ERCC1 mRNA and protein expression, using the FL297 antibody, are predictive factors for survival in cervical cancer patients treated with RT, with ERCC1 FL297 expression independently associated with survival. These results identify a subset of patients who may derive the greatest benefit from the addition of cisplatin chemotherapy.

In all, 15 out of these cases also received cetuximab at the approved dosage of 250 mg/㎡ per week). Appropriate shielding of the spinal cord was considered in the planning to keep the biological dose to 44Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) tend to repopulate malignant tumours during radiotherapy and, therefore, prolongation of the overall treatment time may result in radiotherapy failure. Thus, an estimate of the number of CSCs in tumour biopsies may prove most useful in predicting resistance to radiotherapy and a guide for development therapies aimed to eradicate a cancer cell population with effects on radiotherapy-related cancer regrowth. METHODS: The CSC population was investigated semi-quantitatively in 74 locally advanced squamous cell head-neck cancers (HNSCC) from an equal number of patients, treated with accelerated platinum-based radiotherapy. A standard immunohistochemical technique and the CSC markers CD44, CD24, Oct4, integrin-β1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase isoform 1A1 (ALDHA1) was used, in parallel with the proliferation marker MIB-1. The results were correlated with the site of the tumour, the MIB-1 index, the tumour grade and stage, and prognosis. RESULTS: The expression of CD44, CD24 and Oct4 were significantly associated with the MIB-1 proliferation index. In addition, the CD44 was linked with the better differentiated HNSCC. The CD44, Oct4 and integrin-β1 were all associated with poor prognosis but, in a multivariate analysis, the integrin-β1 had an independent statistical significance in terms of local relapse, distant metastases and overall survival. Interestingly, ALDH1 was associated with favourable prognosis. CONCLUSION: CSC markers are linked with poor radiotherapy outcome in HNSCC, with integrin-β1 being the strongest and independent prognostic factor. Targeting CSC molecules with monoclonal antibodies or pharmaceutical agents may prove important for the treatment of HNSCC.	British Journal of Cancer	N-: 39 patients, N+: 35 patients.

Briefly, preoperative radiotherapy was delivered to the whole pelvis region at a dose of 40.4‒50.4 Gy. Preoperative chemotherapy was concurrently administered with radiotherapy based on a 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine regimen. All patients underwent radical surgery 6 to 8 weeks after preoperative chemoradiation. Of the 210 patients, 195 (92.9%) received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The expression of p53 in patients with rectal cancer who underwent preoperative chemoradiation and and its potential prognostic significance were evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: p53 expression was examined using immunohistochemistry in pathologic specimens from 210 rectal cancer patients with preoperative chemoradiotherapy and radical surgery. All patients were classified into two groups according to the p53 expression: low p53 (<50% nuclear staining) and high p53 (≥50%) groups. RESULTS: p53 expression was significantly associated with tumor location from the anal verge (p=0.036). In univariate analysis, p53 expression was not associated with disease-free survival (p=0.118) or local recurrence-free survival (p=0.089). Multivariate analysis showed that tumor distance from the anal verge (p=0.006), ypN category (p=0.011), and perineural invasion (p=0.048) were independent predictors of disease-free survival; tumor distance from the anal verge was the only independent predictor of local recurrence-free survival. When the p53 groups were subdivided according to ypTNM category, disease-free survival differed significantly in patients with ypN+ disease (p=0.027) only. CONCLUSION: Expression of p53 in pathologic specimens as measured by immunohistochemical methods may have a significant prognostic impact on survival in patients with ypN+ rectal cancer with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. However, it was not an independent predictor of recurrence or survival.	Yonsei Medical Journal	T1-2: 80 patients, T3-4: 130 patients; N-: 138 patients, N+: 72 patients.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	CD133 has been identified as a putative cancer stem cell (CSC) marker in various cancers including colorectal cancer. The relation between CD133 expression and biological characteristics of colorectal cancer remains to be clarified. Protein expression of CD133 was immunohistochemically evaluated in surgical specimens of 225 patients with colorectal cancer who were treated by surgery, as well as those of 78 patients with rectal cancer who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by curative resection. The correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological features, tumor recurrence and overall survival was analyzed in both populations. Among 225 colorectal cancers without CRT, 93 (41.3%) were positive for CD133 expression, which was enhanced in cases with advanced T stage and venous invasion. Moreover, CD133 was positive in 47 (60.3%) of 78 cases with CRT, which was significantly higher than the CD133-positive rate in non-CRT specimens (P=0.05). Expression of CD133 was independently correlated with the histological tumor regression grade (P<0.01). These results suggest that CD133 is not a distinctive colorectal CSC marker; expression of CD133 is suggested to be one of the key factors associated with resistance to CRT in colorectal cancer.

290	Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 overexpression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an independent poor prognosticator that enhances cell growth	English	2012	21300475	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21300475	Journal Article	\N	89	63	26	48	\N	[29.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients received complete course of radiotherapy (RT, total dose ≥6,300 cGy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: As a key component of polycomb-repressive complex 2, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) represses target genes through histone methylation and is frequently overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in common carcinomas. For the first time, we reported EZH2 expression and its biological and clinical significance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: In NPC cell lines and specimens, endogenous expression of EZH2 mRNA and protein was determined by semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting, respectively. To analyze the effect on cell growth, stable silencing of EZH2 was established in EZH2-expressing TW02 NPC cells with RNA interference. EZH2 immunolabeling was assessable for 89 primary NPC biopsy samples and correlated with clinicopathological variables, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Growth activity of TW02 cells was significantly suppressed (p < 0.001) with stable EZH2 silencing. Compared with normal nasopharyngeal tissue, expression levels of EZH2 transcript and protein were apparently upregulated in NPC specimens. As a continuous variable, higher EZH2 expression preferentially occurred in NPCs of T3 to T4 stages (p = 0.03) and significantly predicted inferior DSS (p = 0.0010) and OS (p = 0.004). The prognostic implications for DSS (p = 0.010) and OS (p = 0.006) still remained valid when using the median (≥ 60%) of EZH2 immunolabeling index to dichotomize the cohort. In the multivariate model, higher EZH2 expression was an independent adverse factor of both DSS (p = 0.012) and OS (p = 0.011), along with American Joint Committee on Cancer Stages III to IV (p = 0.024 for DSS, p = 0.017 for OS). CONCLUSION: At least partly through promoting cell growth, EZH2 implicates disease progression, confers tumor aggressiveness, and represents an independent adverse prognosticator in patients with NPC.

291	Associations of Rsf-1 overexpression with poor therapeutic response and worse survival in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2012	22081787	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081787	Journal Article	\N	108	82	26	\N	48	[20.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The percentage of tumour cells with RSF1 immunoexpression was recorded for each NPC specimen and classified into five groups of various expression levels from 0 to 4+, denoting none, 1-24%, 25-49%, 50-74% and 75-100% of tumour cells with moderate to strong nuclear reactivity, respectively. For statistical analysis, RSF1 overexpression was defined as cases featuring 3+ or 4+ immunoreactivity.	All 108 patients were regularly monitored after radiotherapy until death or their last appointment, with the mean follow-up duration being 64.3 months (range 4-117). Nevertheless, treated in the earlier phase of this cohort, seven patients were not available to obtain instantaneous image studies after therapy as the baseline for treatment response evaluation. Another 101 patients received a complete course of radiotherapy (total dose ≥7000 cGy) and also cisplatin-based chemotherapy in the case of stage IIeIV disease, based on the published protocol.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	AIMS: Deregulated chromatin remodelling often leads to aberrant gene expression in cells, thereby implicating tumour development and progression. As a subunit of remodelling and spacing factor complex, Rsf-1 (HBXAP), a novel nuclear protein with histone chaperon function, mediates ATPase-dependent chromatin remodelling and confers tumour aggressiveness in common carcinomas. However, the expression of Rsf-1 has never been reported in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). This study aimed at evaluating the expression status, associations with clincopathological variables and prognostic implications of Rsf-1 in a well-defined cohort of NPC. METHODS: Rsf-1 immunoexpression was retrospectively assessed in biopsies of 108 consecutive NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and treated with consistent guidelines. The results were correlated with the clinicopathological features, therapeutic response, local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: Present in 49 cases (45%), Rsf-1 overexpression was associated with N(2,3) status (p=0.016), American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 3, 4 (p=0.004), and incomplete therapeutic response (p=0.041). In multivariate analyses, Rsf-1 overexpression not only emerged as the sole independent adverse prognosticator for LRFS (p=0.0002, RR 5.287) but also independently predicted worse DMFS (p=0.0011, RR 3.185) and DSS (p<0.0001, RR 4.442), along with T(3,4) (p=0.0454) and N(2,3) (p=0.0319), respectively. CONCLUSION: Rsf-1 overexpression is common and is associated with adverse prognosticators and therapeutic response, which confers tumour aggressiveness through chromatin remodelling, and represents a potential prognostic biomarker in NPC.

292	Effect of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 expression on distant metastasis and survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients	English	2009	18538504	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18538504	Journal Article	\N	233	154	79	48	\N	[17.0,81.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Scoring of SKP2 immunoreactivity was evaluated using a combination of the percentage and intensity of positively stained tumor nuclei to generate an H-score.	All patients were regularly monitored after radiotherapy until death or their last apponiment according to the intervals and protocols of follow-up as detailed in our previous studies.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) oncoprotein is an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting the p27(Kip1) tumor suppressor for degradation. We evaluated the prognostic utility of Skp2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), with an emphasis on distant metastasis-free (DMF) survival. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Immunohistochemical expression of Skp2 was assessed by H-score for 233 NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and correlated with the clinicopathologic features, therapeutic modalities, locoregional control rate, DMF survival, and overall survival (OS). No selection bias in essential parameters was shown between these and another 113 control patients. RESULTS: Skp2 was detectable in most patients (95%) but displayed a wide range of expression. Despite no correlation between Skp2 and any clinicopathologic factor, greater Skp2 expression (H-score >80) significantly portended inferior DMF survival (p = 0.01) and OS (p = 0.02) when categorically dichotomizing the study cohort. The associations with DMF survival (p = 0.003) and OS (p = 0.003) became even stronger when the H-score was expressed as a continuous variable. In the multivariate model, greater Skp2 expression remained significantly predictive of poorer DMF survival and OS (p = 0.01 for both), along with T stage (p = 0.04 for DMF survival; p = 0.005 for OS), N stage (p = 0.008 for DMF survival; p = 0.02 for OS), and/or age (p = 0.001 for OS). In contrast, T stage (p = 0.01) was the single independent prognosticator of LCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that Skp2 expression is frequent in NPC and has a wide range of distribution in H-score. Skp2 overexpression is significantly predictive of DMF survival and OS, independent of the T stage and/or older age. Therefore, Skp2 might represent a useful prognostic adjunct to risk stratify NPC patients for appropriate allocation of adjuvant therapy.

The accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy consisted of the delivery of 72 Gy in 42 fractions over a 6-week period, with a concomitant boost of twice-daily irradiation for 12 treatment days (as previously reported 9 ), and standard-fractionation radiotherapy consisted of the delivery of 70 Gy in 35 fractions (i.e., 2 Gy per fraction) over a 7-week period. Intravenous cisplatin was administered at a dose of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1 and 22 in the accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy group and on days 1, 22, and 43 in the standard-fractionation radiotherapy group.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3% vs. 64.3%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4%, vs. 57.1% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer.

296	Evaluation of immunohistochemical expression of p53, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and Ki67 in oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2012	21883486	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21883486	Journal Article	\N	111	78	33	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Chemoradiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin C (MMC) prior to radical surgery has been used at our institution as a standard treatment protocol since 1990.  The neoadjuvant treatment plan included chemotherapy regimen of MMC (15-20 mg/㎡, i.v. bolus injection on day 1) and 5-FU (750 mg/㎡/day, continuous infusion on days 1-5), concurrent with radiation therapy delivered up to a total dose of 50 Gy (25 fractions of 2 Gy per day).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the immunohistochemical expression of p53, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and Ki67 can predict therapy response and survival in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: Biomarker expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pretreatment biopsies of 111 homogenously treated patients. We assessed the association between clinicopathological variables including response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as well as the survival of the patients and the expression of the biomarkers as both dichotomized (positive vs. negative) and continuous variables. RESULTS: Biomarker overexpression on the basis of pre-selected cutoff points was seen in 66 of 111 (59%) cases for p53, in 77 (69%) for p21, in 48 (43%) for p27, in 81 (73%) for cyclin D1, and in 54 (49%) cases for Ki67, respectively. None of the examined biomarkers was able to predict response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or was associated with survival outcome. Post-treatment pathologic TNM stage (P < 0.001), pathologic response (P < 0.001), and perineural invasion (P < 0.001) were the only factors having a significant effect on recurrence-free survival. Post-treatment pathologic N stage (P = 0.005), post-treatment pathologic TNM stage (P < 0.001), pathologic response (P < 0.001), and perineural invasion (P = 0.001) had a significant impact on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the biomarkers p53, p21, p27, cyclin D1, and Ki67 have no impact on treatment response and survival in patients with oral and oropharyngeal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation.

297	Human papillomavirus positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx: a radiosensitive subgroup of head and neck carcinoma	English	2001	11550151	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11550151	Journal Article	\N	99	75	24	57	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All individuals were irradiated with curative intention. Twenty-seven patients received a concomitant chemotherapy. Megavoltage radiotherapy was administered by linear accelerator in daily fractions, 5 times a week for 5-8 weeks. A median total dose of 74 grays (Gy; range, 54-80.5) was delivered.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic evidence points to a connection between viral infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and a subgroup of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx. To assess the impact of HPV infection on the response of these tumors toward radiotherapy, the authors retrospectively determined the presence of the virus and the integrity of the viral E2 gene in tumors of patients who have undergone curative irradiation. METHODS: Paraffin embedded biopsies from 99 patients were analyzed for HPV infection and E2 gene integrity by multiplex PCR. The experimental findings were correlated with clinical characteristics, known risk factors, and treatment outcome. RESULTS: Fourteen of 99 tumors were HPV positive (11 HPV16, 1 HPV33, 1 HPV35, and 1 HPV45). Human papillomavirus positivity was closely linked to female gender (odds ratio [OR], 5.75; P = 0.004), age older than 56 years (OR, 7.42; P = 0.012), nonsmokers (OR, 21.33; P = 0.00001), and alcohol abstainers (OR, 5.35; P = 0.012). There was an inverse association with p53 nuclear immunoreactivity (OR, 0.06; P = 0.008). The Kaplan-Meier survival estimates showed a better local control (P = 0.050, log-rank) and a better overall survival (P = 0.046, log-rank) for patients with HPV positive tumors. In the multivariate analysis, HPV positivity remained to be associated with a lower risk of local failure (risk ratio [RR], 0.31; P = 0.048). Four of 11 HPV16 positive tumors had a disrupted E2 gene. Only tumors with a disrupted E2 gene manifested local treatment failure. CONCLUSIONS: Human papillomavirus positivity designates a specific subgroup of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx that arise preferentially among individuals with no consumption of tobacco and alcohol and that have a favorable outcome attributable to an increased sensitivity toward radiotherapy.

298	Intratumoral microvessel density predicts local treatment failure of radically irradiated squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx	English	2000	10924967	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10924967	Journal Article	\N	100	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	In our study, staining for TP53 was considered to be positive if more than 10% of the 500 cells counted expressed the protein. Both the extent of staining (relative number of VEGFA-positive cells; extent of extracellular matrix staining with THBS1) and the intensity of the reaction were taken into account. For the statistical analysis, patients were assigned to one of two categories (0/+ vs. ++/+++).	All patients were prepared for radiotherapy by placement of a thermoplast mask, planning CT, two- or three-dimensional-based planning and control by simulator and portal vision imaging device. Megavoltage radiation therapy was administered by a linear accelerator in daily fractions, 5 times a week for 5-8 weeks. A median total dose of 74 Gy (range, 54-80.5) was delivered, 97% of patients receiving at least 66 Gy. Twenty-seven patients underwent concomitant chemotherapy, which consisted mainly of a cisplatin (CDDP)-containing regimen: 12 patients were subjected to CDDP monotherapy, 13 patients had a combination with CDDP and 5-fluorouracil, 1 patient received methotrexate, and 1 carboplatin.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To determine the predictive value of intratumoral microvessel density (IMD), and of the expression of p53, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) for the radiocurability of patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 139 patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx were radically irradiated (median dose, 74 Gy) between 1991 and 1997. Biopsies from 100 patients were processed for immunohistochemistry. IMD was determined in hot spot areas of tissue stained with anti-CD31 at a magnification of x200. Staining for p53 was considered positive if more than 10% of the cell nuclei overexpressed the protein. Immunostaining of VEGF and TSP-1 was assessed semiquantitatively. RESULTS: Increasing IMD (range, 54-282) was strongly correlated with incomplete remission of both the primary tumors (p = 0.01) and lymph node metastases (p = 0.02). Moreover, multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed local failure-free survival to decline with increasing IMD (IMD continuous: risk ratio = 1.01 per increase of 1 microvessel, p = 0. 0001; IMD categorical: </= 80: baseline, 81-110: risk ratio = 2.71, 111-130: risk ratio = 4.55, > 130: risk ratio = 13.01). Neither the expression of p53, nor that of VEGF or TSP-1 was associated with the treatment outcome or IMD, but VEGF and TSP-1 expression were positively correlated (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: IMD represents a powerful and independent predictive factor for local treatment failure in radically irradiated patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx.

299	Comparative prognostic value of HPV16 E6 mRNA compared with in situ hybridization for human oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma	English	2009	19884544	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19884544	Journal Article	\N	111	82	29	57	58.7000000000000028	[27.0,93.0)	Immunohistochemistry	TP53 immunoreactivity was scored positive when ≥10% of tumor nuclei expressed TP53.  The scoring system included percentage of tumor cells staining (0 to 5), and intensity evaluation (1+ to 3+); any multiplied values ≥10 were considered as EGFR positive.	All patients were treated with curativeintent,and underwent computed tomography treatment planning for either conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) approaches. The period of this review overlapped with the introduction of IMRT at PMH, hence 34 (31%) of 110 patients received IMRT. Overall, 67 (60%) of 111 patients were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone; the remaining 44 (40%) received concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) with high-dose cisplatin.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: A significant proportion of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) are associated with the human papilloma virus (HPV), particularly HPV16. The optimal method for HPV determination on archival materials however, remains unclear. We compared a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay for HPV16 mRNA to a DNA in situ hybridization (ISH) method, and evaluated their significance for overall (OS) and disease-free (DFS) survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Matched, archival biopsies from 111 patients with OSCC were evaluated for HPV16 using a qRT-PCR for E6 mRNA and ISH for DNA. Immunohistochemistry for p16, p53, and epidermal growth factor receptor were also performed. RESULTS: HPV16 E6 mRNA was positive in 73 (66%) of 111 samples; ISH was positive in 62 of 106 samples (58%), with 86% concordance. P16 was overexpressed in 72 samples (65%), which was strongly associated with HPV16 status by either method. E6 mRNA presence or p16 overexpression were significantly associated with superior OS; E6 mRNA, HPV16 ISH, or p16 were all significantly associated with DFS. On multivariate analysis adjusted for age, stage, and treatment, positive E6 mRNA was the only independent predictor for superior OS; for DFS, p16 expression or HPV16 status determined by either method was significant. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of HPV16 in OSCC ranges from 58% to 66%, in a recently treated Canadian cohort. Classification of HPV-positivity by HPV16 E6 mRNA, HPV16 ISH or p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is associated with improved DFS. However, the latter two assays are technically easier to perform; hence, HPV16 ISH or p16 IHC should become standard evaluations for all patients with OSCC.

300	Prognostic significance of tumor hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha expression for outcome afterradiotherapy in oropharyngeal cancer	English	2008	19028277	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19028277	Journal Article	\N	133	102	31	59.1000000000000014	\N	[28.3,91.9)	Immunohistochemistry	Batch-to-batch variation was assessed by choosing two sections showing high and low HIF1A expression and running additional sections from these biopsies with each batch. The scoring system was as follows: 0, no nuclear staining; 1, less than 10% nuclear staining; 2, 10% to 29% nuclear staining; and 3, 30% or greater nuclear staining.	Megavoltage radiotherapy was delivered by means of a 4-MV linear accelerator in daily fractions five times a week for 3 weeks. The prescribed radiation dose at the time for posterior tongue tumors was 50 Gy using lateral parallel pair radiation in 16 fractions. Tonsillar tumors received ipsilateral therapy of 52.50 Gy in 16 fractions.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a heterogeneous group of patients in terms of subsite, treatment, and biology. Currently most management decisions are based on clinical parameters with little appreciation of patient differences in underlying tumor biology. We investigated the prognostic significance of clinicopathologic features and tumor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression in a homogeneous series of patients who underwent radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: An audit identified 133 consecutive patients with histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil or tongue base. All patients received primary radiotherapy between 1996 and 2001. Tumor HIF-1alpha expression was examined in 79 patients. RESULTS: Features associated with poor locoregional control were low Hb level (p = 0.05) and advancing T (p = 0.008), N (p = 0.03), and disease (p = 0.008) stage. HIF-1alpha expression was a more significant adverse prognostic factor in the tonsil (hazard ratio [HR], 23.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 3.04-176.7) than the tongue-base tumor (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.14-7.19) group (p = 0.03, test for interaction). High tumor HIF-1alpha expression was associated with low blood Hb levels (p = 0.03). In a multivariate analysis HIF-1alpha expression retained prognostic significance for locoregional control (HR, 7.10; 95% CI, 3.07-16.43) and cancer-specific survival (HR, 9.19; 95% CI, 3.90-21.6). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in radiation therapy outcome within a homogeneous subsite of the oropharynx related to molecular marker expression. The work highlights the importance of studying homogeneous groups of patients in HNSCC, and the complex interrelationships between tumor biology and clinicopathologic factors. The establishment of tumor-type specific markers would represent a major advance in this area.

301	Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha: a novel predictive and prognostic parameter in the radiotherapy of oropharyngeal cancer	English	2001	11306467	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11306467	Journal Article	\N	98	\N	\N	57	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Both the extent of staining (relative number of HIF1A -positive cells) and the intensity of the reaction were taken into account: 2, not detected; +, <1% positive cells; ++, 1-10% positive cells with slight to moderate staining or 10-50% positive cells with slight staining; +++, 10-50% positive cells with moderate to marked staining; ++++, >50% positive cells with moderate to marked staining. For all statistical tests, the five grades of staining were reduced to three: 0, not detected; I, weak (+/++); II, strong (+++/++++).	Megavoltage radiation was delivered by means of a linear accelerator in daily fractions, five times/week for 5-8 weeks. A median total dose of 74 Gy (range, 54-80.5) was administered; 97% of the patients received at least 66 Gy. Twenty-seven patients were subjected to concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, 12 patients underwent cisplatin monotherapy, and 13 were treated with both cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil; 1 individual received methotrexate, and 1 patient received carboplatin. 	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Hypoxia has long been recognized as detrimental to the successful treatment of malignant tumors with ionizing radiation. Because hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha plays an essential role in oxygen homeostasis in vitro, we explored the predictive potential of this factor in a cohort of 98 patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx, who were treated by curative radiation therapy. Ninety-four % of the primary tumors showed overexpression of HIF-1alpha, relative to the surrounding tissue, as determined by immunohistochemistry. The degree of HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity correlated inversely with both the rate of complete remission of the primary tumor (odds ratio, 0.33; P = 0.03) and lymph node metastases (odds ratio, 0.34; P = 0.02) as well as with local failure-free survival (risk ratio, 2.15; P = 0.006), disease-free survival (risk ratio, 2.01; P = 0.008), and overall survival (risk ratio, 2.17; P = 0.002). The multivariate analysis revealed the predictive power of HIF-1alpha to be independent of other covariables. We conclude that HIF-1alpha is overexpressed in the vast majority of patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx and that the degree of expression has predictive and prognostic significance in individuals undergoing curative radiation therapy.

All the patients received definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer with curative doses with a range of 60-72 Gy. Out of the 48 patients, 34 (71%) received neoadjuvant and/or concurrent systemic chemotherapy. Salvage surgery was performed in 4 patients.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of dysadherin and E-cadherin expression on the clinical outcomes, including the treatment outcomes and recurrence pattern, in patients with head and neck cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens were obtained from 48 head and neck cancer patients who were treated by radiation therapy and the specimens were immunohistochemically stained for dysadherin and E-cadherin. The expressions were graded according to the percentage area occupied by cancer cells showing positive staining for E-cadherin and dysadherin as follows: grade 0, less than 10%; grade 1, 10-50%; grade 2, more than 50%. The correlations between the expression of E-cadherin and dysadherin and the clinical outcomes, including the treatment outcomes and recurrence pattern, were analyzed. RESULTS: The complete response (CR) rate in the patients with a dysadherin expression grade of 0 or 1 was 70% and that in the patients with dysadherin expression grade of 2 was 38%; the difference was significant (p < 0.05). Regarding the pattern of recurrence, the expression grade of dysadherin or E-cadherin alone was not correlated with the recurrence pattern; however, patients with a difference in the expression grade between dysadherin and E-cadherin (Dys-Ecad value) of 1 or 2 showed a significantly higher rate of lymph node and/or distant metastasis (55%) as compared with those with a Dys-Ecad value of < 1 (22%) (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Dysadherin and E-cadherin expression might serve as useful prognostic factors in patients with head and neck cancer treated by definitive radiation therapy.

Twenty-seven patients were subjected to concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CDDP), 12 of these undergoing CDDP monotherapy and 13 being treated with both CDDP and 5-fluorouracil; 1 individual received methotrexate and one received carboplatin.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The activation of cytoplasmic signal transduction pathways by a number of growth factors and their tyrosine-kinase receptors, including hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and its receptor c-met, exerts an inhibitory influence on apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation in vitro. The clinical relevance of the aforementioned ligand-receptor pair, of Bcl-xL, which is targeted by HGF/SF/c-met signaling, and of Bcl-2, was assessed by evaluating their predictive and prognostic impact in a cohort of 97 patients with radically irradiated squamous cell cancers of the oropharynx. Immunohistochemical expression of c-met and Bcl-xL was correlated with decreased rates of complete remission of the primary tumor in both the univariate (c-met: P = 0.01; Bcl-xL: P = 0.001) and multivariate analyses. Expression of c-met was, moreover, a significant and independent predictor of impaired local failure-free survival (P = 0.003), disease-free survival (P = 0.003) and overall survival (p = 0.001). Bcl-2 expression was, on the other hand, associated with a favorable outcome, in terms of both local failure-free survival (P = 0.01) and overall survival (P = 0.001). In accordance with in vitro data, c-met and Bcl-xL appear to be involved in the resistance of oropharyngeal cancers to ionizing radiation, and may therefore represent attractive targets for radiosensitization.

Patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or gross total surgical resection and postoperative external beam radiotherapy. The mean dose of radiation was 60 Gy. Forty-seven patients (57%) received a radical or modified radical neck dissection, and 35 patients (43%) received brachytherapy. Twenty-three patients (28%) received chemotherapy, with 16 receiving the hypoxic cytotoxins porfiromycin or mitomycin C as part of an institutional protocol.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the relative prognostic significance of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included 82 patients with SCC referred to the Department of Therapeutic Radiology at Yale-New Haven Hospital (Connecticut) between 1980 and 1999 who were treated with primary external beam radiotherapy or gross total surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy. A microarray of archival tumor tissue was constructed and stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against COX-2 and scored for intensity by a pathologist blinded to the clinical outcomes of the patients. COX-2 immunoreactivity and clinicopathological data were analyzed with respect to survival endpoints using bivariate and multivariate techniques. RESULTS: Frequency of COX-2 overexpression was 45%. In multivariate analysis, COX-2 positivity predicted poor 3-year survival (P = 0.02; odds ratio = 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.84). Increasing age was significantly associated with increased 3-year survival (P = 0.03; odds ratio = 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.004-1.09). Positive COX-2 status trended toward predicting decreased 3-year disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: COX-2 was the most important predictor of poor survival in this patient cohort. In patients with oropharyngeal SCC treated with external-beam radiation therapy, overexpression of COX-2 may affect clinical outcome, and COX-2 may therefore prove valuable both as a prognostic factor and as a therapeutic target.

305	Quantitative determination of nuclear and cytoplasmic epidermal growth factor receptor expression in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer by using automated quantitative analysis	English	2005	16115926	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115926	Journal Article	\N	95	74	21	61	\N	[41.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Patients were treated with primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or gross total surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy and 2 (2.9%) not recorded. Twenty-one patients (22.1%) were treated with chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Several lines of evidence support the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a molecular target for therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Determination of tumor EGFR levels by conventional immunohistochemistry has not always predicted antitumor efficacy. Quantitative assays may provide more accurate assessment of the level of EGFR receptor in the tumor, which may thus provide more reliable prognostic and predictive information. We studied the prognostic value of quantitative assessment of EGFR in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancers treated with radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied EGFR protein expression on a tissue microarray composed of 95 oropharyngeal cancer cases using an in situ molecular-based method of quantitative assessment of protein expression (AQUA) and correlated those with clinical and pathologic data. Automated, quantitative analysis uses cytokeratin to define pixels as cancer (tumor mask) within the array spot and measures intensity of EGFR expression using a Cy5-conjugated antibody within the mask. A continuous index score is generated, which is directly proportional to the number of molecules per unit area, and cases were defined as high expressing if they were above the median expression level. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time for survivors was 44.9 months, and for the entire cohort was 34.8 months. Patients with high tumor EGFR expression levels had a local recurrence rate of 58% compared with 17% for patients with low EGFR tumor expression (P < 0.01). Similarly, patients with high nuclear EGFR expression had a local recurrence rate of 54% compared with 21% for patients with low EGFR nuclear expression (P < 0.05). Additionally, patients with high tumor and nuclear EGFR levels had inferior disease-free survival compared with low expressors (19% versus 43% and 19% versus 45%, respectively. P < 0.05 for each). In multivariate analysis adjusting for well-characterized prognostic variables, high tumor and nuclear EGFR expression levels retained their prognostic significance. CONCLUSION: The AQUA system provides a continuous measurement of EGFR on paraffin-embedded tissue and was able to reveal the association between EGFR expression and outcome expected from the biological role of EGFR. In the future, EGFR AQUA score may be useful in predicting response to EGFR-targeted therapies.	Clinical Cancer Research	Stage II: 11 patients, Stage III: 27 patients, Stage IV: 57 patients.
311	Impact of HPV-associated p16-expression on radiotherapy outcome in advanced oropharynx and non-oropharynx cancer	English	2014	25544647	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25544647	Journal Article	\N	1294	1024	270	59	\N	[28.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Up until 2006 the scoring was done retrospectively and a tumor was classified as CDKN2A-positive in case of strong, diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmatic staining in more than 70% of carcinoma cells, but tumors displaying a conventional keratinizing morphology together with a variable or patchy CDKN2A-expression staining pattern were classified as CDKN2A-negative.	All patients were treated with curatively intended primary (chemo)radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: HPV is found in head and neck cancer from all sites with a higher prevalence in oropharynx cancer (OPC) compared to non-OPC. HPV/p16-status has a significant impact on radiotherapy (RT) outcome in advanced OPC, but less is known about the influence in non-OPC. We analyzed HPV-associated p16-expression in a cohort of patients with stage III-IV pharynx and larynx cancer treated with primary, curatively intended (chemo-)RT, aiming to test the hypothesis that the impact of HPV/p16 also extends to tumors of non-oropharyngeal origin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 1294 patients enrolled in previously conducted DAHANCA-trials between 1992 and 2012 were identified. Tumors were evaluated by p16-immunohistochemistry and classified as positive in case of staining in >70% of tumors cells. RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (490/1294) of the tumors were p16-positive with a significantly higher frequency in OPC (425/815) than in non-OPC (65/479), p<.0001. In OPC p16-positivity significantly improved loco-regional control (LRC) (adjusted HR [95% CI]: 0.43 [0.32-0.57]), event-free survival (EFS) (HR 0.44 [0.35-0.56]), and overall survival (OS) (HR: 0.38 [0.29-0.49]), respectively, compared with p16-negativity. In non-OPC no prognostic impact of p16-status was found for either endpoint: LRC (HR: 1.13 [0.75-1.70]), EFS (HR: 1.06 [0.76-1.47]), and OS (HR: 0.82 [0.59-1.16]). CONCLUSIONS: The independent influence of HPV-associated p16-expression in advanced OPC treated with primary RT was confirmed. However, RT-outcome in the group of non-OPC did not differ by tumor p16-status, indicating that the prognostic impact may be restricted to OPC only.

306	Prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels in T1-2 N0 laryngeal cancer treated with primary radiation therapy	English	2007	17183558	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17183558	Journal Article	White; Black	123	106	17	64	\N	[38.0,90.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For TP53, <20% nuclear reactivity in tumor cells was scored as 1 (low p53 expression), and ≥20% nuclear reactivity was scored as 2 (high TP53 expression).	Radiation treatment parameters as follows: bilateral laryngeal opposed wedged fields using beam energies ranging fro㎡ to 6 MV, 5 fractions per week, without planned treatment breaks. Patients were treated with a median daily fraction of 200 cGy (range, 180-255 cGy) to a total median dose of 66 Gy (range, 49.5-79 Gy) over 47 days (range, 27-78 days).	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic value of vascular endothelial growth factor protein levels in a large cohort of patients with T1-T2 N0 laryngeal cancer treated with primary radiation therapy (XRT). METHODS: Primary tumor specimens from a cohort of 123 patients with T1-T2 N0 laryngeal cancer treated with XRT between 1975 and 2000 were constructed into a tissue microarray. Clinical prognostic factors included age, sex, T classification, and tumor subsite. Molecular prognostic factors included vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and p53 expression, determined by using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. The association between vascular endothelial growth factor status, covariables, and outcome was assessed. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 32 (26%) were diagnosed with local relapse (5-year local relapse-free rate, 70.4%). T2 tumor stage (31.7%) was a significant predictor of local relapse (relative risk [RR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-2.43; P<.05). Positive expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor receptor, and p53 were: 8.5%, 58.7%, and 36.4%, respectively. In univariate analysis, vascular endothelial growth factor positivity was a significant predictor of overall survival (RR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.99-2.42; P = .05). In multivariate analysis, positive vascular endothelial growth factor status maintained significant correlation with overall survival (RR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.49-4.95; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Vascular endothelial growth factor positivity appeared to be a significant predictor of overall survival in a multivariate model. Further evaluation of vascular endothelial growth factor-positive laryngeal cancers treated with primary XRT is warranted.	Cancer	T1: 84 patients, T2: 39 patients.
307	Cyclin d1 is a valuable prognostic marker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2005	15709184	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15709184	Journal Article	\N	96	75	21	61.5	\N	[41.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Patients were treated with primary external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or gross total surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy and 2 (2.9%) not recorded. Twenty-one patients (22.1%) were treated with chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The current tumor-node-metastasis system is inadequate to accurately classify patients in terms of prognosis. Thus, with the availability of recently developed molecular tools, considerable interest lies in discovering prognostic markers in order to guide treatment decisions. In this study, we sought to determine the prognostic significance of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied the protein expression levels of cyclin D1 on a tissue microarray composed of 63 OSCCs with long-term follow-up data available. Protein expression was analyzed with an automated in situ quantitative (AQUA) method which allows preservation of tissue morphology while quantifying protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissue. RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 35 months. High cyclin D1 nuclear expression was associated with increased 5-year local recurrence rate (48% versus 15%), inferior 5-year disease-free survival (16% versus 58%), and inferior 5-year overall survival (17% versus 53%). In multivariate Cox regression, high nuclear cyclin D1 expression was an independent predictor for local recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that quantitative assessment of nuclear cyclin D1 expression level by automated in situ quantitative analysis is a strong predictor for outcome in OSCC. Thus, cyclin D1 may be a potential target for molecular intervention in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer.

308	Bcl-2 blocks cisplatin-induced apoptosis and predicts poor outcome following chemoradiation treatment in advanced oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2009	19240170	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19240170	Journal Article	\N	38	31	7	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	An intensity score (0, absent; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and a prevalence score (0, <25% of tumor stained; 1, 25-75% stained; 2, >75% stained) were added; a total of >3 was called positive.	During the course of radiation, chemotherapy was administered either as cisplatin (100 mg/㎡ i.v. over 1 h) every 3 wk for up to 3 cycles, or as weekly administrations of carboplatin (area under thecurve = 1.5 i.v. over 30 min) and paclitaxel (45 mg/㎡ i.v. over 30 min) for up to 7 treatments as tolerated. Radiation therapy was delivered as intensity modulated radiation therapy five times weekly in daily fractions of 1.8 to 2.12 Gy for a total of 33 to 40 fractions to the gross tumor volume, or as a concomitant boost accelerated fractionation schedule (72 Gy delivered to the gross tumor volume). Lymph nodes received 45 to 60 Gy according to the level of risk.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that elevated expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins predicts a poor therapeutic response of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) to concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w were determined and correlated with resistance to cisplatin in a large panel of cell lines derived from squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL expression and disease-free survival following chemoradiation therapy in a uniformly treated cohort of patients with OPSCC. RESULTS: In HNSCC cell lines, high endogenous Bcl-2 expression was associated with increased cisplatin resistance, and experimental overexpression of Bcl-2 promoted cisplatin resistance. In patients, tumors positive for Bcl-2 before treatment had greater risk of treatment failure (hazard ratio, 5.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.73-20.8; P=0.0014). In contrast, endogenous Bcl-XL showed no correlation either with cisplatin sensitivity in the cell line panel in vitro, or with risk of recurrence in vivo (hazard ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-4.19; P=0.68). Associations between Bcl-2 expression and other clinical characteristics did not account for the predictive value of Bcl-2. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical assessment of Bcl-2 in pretreatment biopsy specimens can predict response of advanced OPSCC to concurrent platinum-based chemoradiation. As treatments targeting Bcl-2 and its family members become available, this immunohistochemical assessment could help personalize therapy by identifying a subpopulation of patients with a poor prognosis who might benefit from such treatments.

309	Prognostic value of expression of EGFR and nm23 for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2012	21221850	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21221850	Journal Article	\N	127	84	43	45	\N	[20.0,63.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The extent of the staining, defined as the proportion of positive staining cells in relation to the whole field, was scored on a scale of 0-4 as 0: ≤5%; 1: 6-25%; 2: 26-50%; 3: 51-75%; and 4: ≥76%. The sum of the staining intensity and staining extent scores (0-7) was used as the final staining score. For statistical analysis, a final staining score of 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, and 6-7 was respectively considered to be negative (−), low (+), medium (++), and high (+++) expression levels, respectively.	All patients in this group were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two to three cycles of cisplatin 30 mg/㎡ and ﬂuorouracil 500 mg/㎡ , repeated every 3 weeks, followed by concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT, weekly cisplatin 40 mg/㎡ during radiotherapy). Patients received radiotherapy by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques, using a fraction dose of 2 Gy to total radiation dose of 70-74 Gy/35-37 fractions. The response to CRT was assessed fro㎡ to 3 months after treatment completion by endoscopy and CT of the nasopharynx. Follow-up assessment of prognosis took place every 3 months for the first 3 years, biannually in years 3-5, and annually thereafter. A complete response was defined as complete regression of all evidence of tumor.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of expression of EGFR and nm23 in patients with advanced-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The study population comprised 127 patients with stage III-IVa NPC with sufficient pretreatment tumor biopsy specimens from 2003 to 2004 and clinical follow-up data. The expression of EGFR and nm23 was detected by immunohistochemistry. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. The correlation between pretreatment expression of EGFR and nm23, and the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy was analyzed. The EGFR expression was correlated with primary lesion stage and clinical stage (P = 0.001, 0.002, respectively). There was a statistically significant association between nm23 expression and local lymph node stage (P = 0.000). The positive EGFR expression had a higher recurrent rate than the negative (P = 0.015). The positive nm23 expression had a lower distant metastasis rate than the negative (P = 0.021). Negative expression of EGFR had a significantly better 5-year OS and DFS than positive expression (P = 0.015, 0.013, respectively). Positive expression of nm23 had a significantly higher 5-year OS and DFS than negative expression (P = 0.001, 0.006, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that both pretreatment EGFR and nm23 expression were strong independent factors for the overall survival of patients with NPC (P = 0.000, 0.000, respectively). Our data suggested that EGFR and nm23 can serve as reliable biomarkers for prognosis prediction in patients with NPC who may benefit from alternate treatment strategy and targeted treatment.

310	Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in squamous cell carcinomas arising from the oropharynx: detection of HPV DNA and p16 immunohistochemistry as diagnostic and prognostic indicators--a pilot study	English	2014	25035216	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25035216	Journal Article	\N	50	39	11	62	\N	[45.0,79.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Positive CDKN2A expression was defined as strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in 70% or more of the tumor cells.	Primary radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy had been recommended to all of the enrolled patients.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection is associated with oropharyngeal carcinogenesis and is likely the cause of the reported increase in disease incidence. We evaluated the prevalence of HPV infection and the reliability of different diagnostic tools using primary tumor samples from a cohort of 50 patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples were collected from all 50 consecutive primary oropharyngeal SCC patients who were enrolled in the study; fresh tumor samples were available in 22 cases. NucliSENS EasyQ HPVv1 was used for RNA, and Digene Hybrid Capture-2(HC2) was used for DNA detection. p16 Expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in FPPE specimens. RESULTS: Based on the DNA detection assay on FFPE samples, the frequency of high-risk HPV infection was 32%. The agreement rate between HPV RNA and HPV DNA detection in fresh samples was 100%. The agreement rate between p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the detection of HPV DNA in the FFPE samples was fair but not excellent (κ = 0.618). HPV DNA detection was highly significant, as measured by disease-specific survival and determined using a Wilcoxon test (P=.001). p16 IHC also exhibited a prognostic value but with a lower statistical significance (P=.0475). The detection of HPV DNA, but not p16 IHC, was also significantly correlated with locoregional control (P=.0461). CONCLUSION: Diagnostic methods based on the detection of HPV nucleic acids appear to be more reliable and objective because they do not require reading by a trained histopathologist. Furthermore, the detection of HPV DNA exhibits an improved correlation with survival, and therefore appears definitely more reliable than p16 IHC for routine use in clinical practice.

312	Prognostic significance of p16INK4A and human papillomavirus in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated on TROG 02.02 phase III trial	English	2010	20697079	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697079	Journal Article	\N	185	156	29	\N	\N	[32.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	All p16 IHC slides were semiquantitatively scored by a pathologist (S.B.F.) for intensity of staining in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Intensity was scored as 0 (none), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong), with 0 or 1 scores defined as negative and 2 or 3 defined as positive.	Arm 1: Cisplatin (100 mg/㎡)was administered over 1 hour on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7, followed by radiotherapy. Ar㎡: Tirapazamine (290 mg/㎡) was administered over 2 hours on day 1 of weeks 1, 4, and 7, followed 1 hour later by cisplatin (75 mg/㎡) over 1 hour, followed immediately by radiotherapy.In addition, tirapazamine (160 mg/㎡) was given before radiation three times per week in weeks 2 and 3. Radiation therapy was the same in both arms. A dose of 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks was delivered to gross disease using a shrinking field technique. Sites potentially harboring subclinical disease (including a minimum of two nodal echelons beyond gross disease) were treated to 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, and areas adjacent to gross disease were treated to 60Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic importance of p16 and human papillomavirus (HPV) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated on a phase III concurrent chemoradiotherapy trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III or IV head and neck squamous cell cancer were randomly assigned to concurrent radiotherapy and cisplatin with or without tirapazamine. In this substudy, analyses were restricted to patients with oropharyngeal cancer. p16 was detected by immunohistochemistry, and HPV was detected by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Slides were available for p16 assay in 206 of 465 patients, of which 185 were eligible, and p16 and HPV were evaluable in 172 patients. One hundred six (57%) of 185 were p16-positive, and in patients evaluable for both p16 and HPV, 88 (86%) of 102 p16-positive patients were also HPV-positive. Patients who were p16-positive had lower T and higher N categories and better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. p16-positive tumors compared with p16-negative tumors were associated with better 2-year overall survival (91% v 74%; hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.74; P = .004) and failure-free survival (87% v 72%; HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.74; P = .003). p16 was a significant prognostic factor on multivariable analysis (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.96; P = .04). p16-positive patients had lower rates of locoregional failure and deaths due to other causes. There was a trend favoring the tirapazamine arm for improved locoregional control in p16-negative patients (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.09 to 1.24; P = .13). CONCLUSION: HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer is a distinct entity with a favorable prognosis compared with HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer when treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy.

Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Patients with tonsillar and base of tongue cancer, which are human papillomavirus (HPV) positive, have a better clinical outcome than those with HPV-negative tumors. The identification of additional predictive markers for response to therapy could still be of great use. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor markers CD44, p16, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), E-cadherin, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX 2), Ki-67, and p27 were analyzed by immunochemistry, and HPV status was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in tumors from 73 patients and correlated to survival. RESULTS: High intensity CD44 staining (p=0.006) and high EGFR expression (p=0.026) were indicators of poor prognosis, while high p16 expression (p=0.021) and younger age (p=0.002) were positive prognostic markers for disease-specific survival. Furthermore, staining of CD44 (p=0.026) and age (p=0.002) were shown to be strong prognostic markers in multivariate analysis, which should be evaluated further for possible use in clinical practice.

For most patients (n = 229, 79%) treatment consisted of conventional radiotherapy (2.0 Gy/day, for 6.5-7 weeks, total dose: 68 Gy) or accelerated radiotherapy (1.1 + 2.0 Gy/day for 4.5 weeks, total dose: 68 Gy), while a minority (n = 61, 21%) also had induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant radiotherapy. Furthermore, some patients also received interstitial radiation (brachytherapy) (total dose of 78 Gy). Finally, patients with nodal disease also underwent neck dissection, 6-8 weeks after completed radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Patients with human papillomavirus DNA positive (HPV(DNA+)) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have better clinical outcome than those with HPV DNA negative (HPV(DNA-)) OSCC upon intensive oncological treatment. All HPV(DNA+) OSCC patients may not require intensive treatment, however, but before potentially deintensifying treatment, additional predictive markers are needed. Here, we examined HPV, p16(INK4a), and CD44 in OSCC in correlation to clinical outcome. Pretreatment tumors from 290 OSCC patients, the majority not receiving chemotherapy, were analyzed for HPV DNA by Luminex and for p16(INK4a) and CD44 by immunohistochemistry. 225/290 (78%) tumors were HPV(DNA+) and 211/290 (73%) overexpressed p16(INK4a), which correlated to presence of HPV (P < 0.0001). Presence of HPV DNA, absent/weak CD44 intensity staining correlated to favorable 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by univariate and multivariate analysis, and likewise for p16(INK4a) by univariate analysis. Upon stratification for HPV, HPV(DNA+) OSCC with absent/weak CD44 intensity presented the significantly best 3-year DFS and OS, with >95% 3-year DFS and OS. Furthermore, in HPV(DNA+) OSCC, p16(INK4a)+ overexpression correlated to a favorable 3-year OS. In conclusion, patients with HPV(DNA+) and absent/weak CD44 intensity OSCC presented the best survival and this marker combination could possibly be used for selecting patients for tailored deintensified treatment in prospective clinical trials.

Radiotherapy: 6MV-X linear accelerator was used for pelvic external radiotherapy, with the total dose of pelvic center being 45 Gy. 192 Ir high dose rate was used for after-loading therapy, with the total dose at A point being 36-42 Gy. Chemotherapy was conducted at the first day of radiotherapy, and TP scheme combined with chemotherapy was used. Paclitaxel 135 mg/㎡ was intravenously dripped on day 1, and cisplatin 50 mg/㎡ was intravenously injected on day 2-3.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level on therapeutic outcome and diagnosis/prognostic value in patients with cervical cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 37 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer by biopsy were selected and treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was adopted before treatment to assess VEGF levels, and its relationships with clinicopathological features and short-term therapeutic effects were analyzed. RESULTS: The median VEGF level in 37 patients before treatment was 647.15 (393.35~1125.16) pg/ mL. Serum VEGF levels in patients aged <50 years, in International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIIa~IVa, with lymph node metastasis and tumor size>4 cm were significantly increased (P<0.05). The complete remission (CR) rate was 48.7% (18/37), partial remission (PR) rate was 35.1% (13/37), stable disease (SD) rate was 13.5% (5/37) and progressive disease (PD) rate was 2.70% (1/37), so the objective remission rate (ORR) after treatment was 83.8% (31/37). Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor size and serum VEGF level before treatment were independent risk factors affecting the therapeutic outcome, and the higher the level of serum VEGF, the worse the prognosis when tumor size>4 cm. Some 56.8% of patients manifested with myelosuppression, 37.8% with leucopenia, 24.3% with thrombocytopenia, 5.41% with diarrhea, 46.0% with nausea and vomiting, 21.6% with hair loss and 8.11% with hepatic and renal injury during the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Serum VEGF level may reflect the degree of malignancy of cervical cancer and predict therapeutic effect, which is of great importance to cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

316	Relationship between the Plasma Transforming Growth Factor-β1 Levels and Radiation-Induced Lung Injury	Chinese	2007	\N	http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&id=syazzz200705009	Journal Article	\N	53	42	11	60.3999999999999986	\N	[33.0,79.0)	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay	Mean	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the pre- and posttreatment plasma TGF-β1 levels, V20 and radiation-induced lung injury. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with lung cancer receiving 3DCRT were included in this study. The radiation was delivered in 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per weeks, with a total dose from 40 to 70 Gy. The percentage of both lung volume receiving 20 Gy or more (V20) was restricted to 35% or less, and dose to the spinal cord was restricted to 45 Gy. Concentrations of pre- and posttreatment plasma TGF-β1 were quantified by ELISA. RESULTS: The radiation induced lung injury was noted in 35.7% (17/53) patients, and 13.2% patients developed Grade 2 or worse radiation-induced lung injury. The incidence of the radiation induced lung injury was 51.9% in patients with elevated posttreatment TGF-β1 levels, and this was significantly higher than those with normal TGF-β1 levels (11.5%) (P=0.002). The pre-treatment TGF-β1 levels had no correlation with radiation-induced lung injury (P=0.315). The radiation-induced lung injury developed in 62.5% patients with V20 >25% and elevated post-treatment TGF-β1 levels, and this was significantly highrer than those of other groups. None of the patients with V20 ≤25% and normal post-treatment TGF-β1 levels developed radiation-induced lung injury. CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced lung injury is related to the plasma TGF-β1 levels at the end of radiation. Patients with V20 >25% and elevated posttreatment TGF-β1 levels are at especially high risk to develop radiation induced lung injury.	The Practical Journal of Cancer	\N

If the immunoreactivity was ≥50%, the sample was classified as positive.	In brief, the chemotherapeutic regimen used for SCC patients consisted of cisplatin 100 mg/㎡ followed by five consecutive daily infusions of 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/㎡. The chemotherapeutic regimen used for ADC patients consisted of 70 mg/㎡ of cisplatin, 250 mg/㎡ of cyclophosphamide, and 45 mg/㎡ of doxorubicin administered on Days 1, 2, and 3, respectively. RT involved a combination of external beam RT (EBRT) and high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy applied using a remote afterloading system with an 192 Ir source (Gamma-Med II). Whole pelvis EBRT was performed using a dose of 1.8 Gy/fraction, five times weekly, to a midline dose of 27-36 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy with six insertions (twice weekly), with fraction doses of 5 Gy to a total dose of 30 Gy at point A. After completing intracavitary brachytherapy, patients were administered a second course of EBRT with central shielding to a total EBRT dose of 45-50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To determine the differential expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the uterine cervix and the prognostic significance of COX-2 expression in these histologic types. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 105 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IIB uterine cervical cancer patients were screened for COX-2 expression immunohistochemically. COX-2 expression was determined in invasive cervical SCC (n = 84) and invasive cervical ADC (n = 21). To determine the clinical significance of COX-2 expression by histologic type, the patients were arbitrarily divided into four groups: SCC/COX-2 negative (n = 64); SCC/COX-2 positive (n = 20); ADC/COX-2 negative (n = 9); and ADC/COX-2 positive (n = 12). The clinical response to treatment, patterns of treatment failure, and survival data by COX-2 expression were compared for these two major histologic types. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors influencing survival. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical examination showed that COX-2 expression was more frequently observed in ADC than in SCC (57% vs. 24%, p = 0.007). Moreover, COX-2 expression was an important predictor of treatment response, irrespective of the histologic type. All COX-2-negative patients achieved complete remission after initial treatment; 17% of SCC patients and 33% of ADC patients with COX-2 expression did not have complete remission after the initial treatment. The incidence of local failure for those with COX-2 expression was significantly greater than for COX-2-negative patients, regardless of histologic type. With a minimal follow-up of 60 months, the overall 5-year actuarial survival rate for SCC and ADC patients was 79% and 62%, respectively (p = 0.05). The 5-year disease-free survival rate for SCC and ADC patients was 73% and 56%, respectively (p = 0.13). Irrespective of the pathologic type, COX-2-positive patients had an unfavorable prognosis. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 57% for COX-2-positive patients and 83% for COX-2-negative patients (p = 0.001). When patients were stratified into the four groups according to histologic type and COX-2 expression status, ADC/COX-2-positive patients had the worst prognosis, with an overall 5-year actuarial survival rate of 49% compared with 78% for ADC/COX-2-negative patients, 62% for SCC/COX-2-positive, and 84% for SCC/COX-2-negative patients (p = 0.007, log-rank test). Irrespective of histologic type, COX-2 expression was an independent prognostic factor by univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: In uterine cervical cancer, COX-2 was expressed in a greater proportion of ADC patients than SCC patients. COX-2 expression was also identified as a major determiner of a poor response to treatment and of an unfavorable prognosis, irrespective of the histologic type, reflecting the importance of the COX-2 protein in the acquisition of biologic aggressiveness and more malignant phenotype or increased resistance to the standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy in both histologic types. Given these observations, we believe that that ADC/COX-2-positive patients might be appropriate candidates for future trials of selective COX-2 inhibitor adjunctive therapy.

318	Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy	English	2002	12209745	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12209745	Journal Article	\N	75	\N	75	\N	\N	[29.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Semiquantitative, three-tier grading was based on the percentage of tumor cells that stained positive in the whole tumor boundary: 0-1, minimal (<10%); 2, moderately stained (<50%); and 3, markedly stained (≥50%). If the distributions of immunoreactivity were ≥50%, then they were classified as the overexpression groups.	Briefly, the patients received three cycles of chemotherapy given concomitantly during Week 1, Week 4, and Week 7 of radiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens consisted of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Cisplatin was given as a daily bolus dose of 100 mg/㎡, and 5-FU was administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion at a dose of 1000 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days. Radiotherapy was delivered with a combination of external irradiation and high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation by a remote afterloading system using iridium 192 sources (Gamma-Med II). External whole pelvis irradiation was performed with a dose of 1.8 grays (Gy) per fraction 5 times per week to a midline dose of 27.0-36.0 Gy. This was followed by high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation with 6 insertions (twice per week) with a fractional dose of 5.0 Gy to a total dose of 30.0 Gy at point A. After high-dose-rate intracavitary radiation, the patients received a second course of external irradiation with central shielding up to a total external dose of 45.0-50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) overexpression was an indicator of prognosis in patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) Stage IIB uterine cervical carcinoma who underwent radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with FIGO Stage IIB squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the uterine cervix who were treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy between 1991 and 1996 were divided into two groups according to their COX-2 level in an immunohistochemical study: the COX-2 negative group (n = 54 patients) and the COX-2 positive group (n = 21 patients). The clinicopathologic features, patterns of treatment failure, and survival data for patients in the COX-2 positive group were compared with data from the patients in the COX-2 negative group. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors that influenced patient survival. RESULTS: In the immunohistochemical study, COX-2 overexpression was observed in approximately 30% of patients with FIGO Stage IIB SCC of the uterine cervix. With delayed regression to the initial treatment, the treatment failure rate of patients in the COX-2 positive group was much higher compared with the treatment failure rate of patients in the COX-2 negative group. The higher incidence of central failure and lymph node failure for patients in the COX-2 positive group was statistically significant (48% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 13% for the COX-2 negative group). However, there was no difference in the incidence of hematogenous metastases between the two groups (5% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 7% for the COX-2 negative group). In addition, increased COX-2 expression in tumor cells also was correlated with a shorter interval to tumor recurrence (median interval to recurrence, 9 months in the COX-2 positive group vs. 26 months in the COX-2 negative group). Compared with patients in the COX-2 negative group, patients in the COX-2 positive group had lower overall actuarial and disease free survival rates (overall 5-year actuarial survival rates: 56% for the COX-2 positive group vs. 94% for the COX-2 negative group; P = 0.003). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that COX-2 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor that surpassed other well-known clinicopathologic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: COX-2 overexpression can be used as a potent molecular risk factor in patients with FIGO Stage IIB SCC of the uterine cervix who are treated with radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy.

319	No significant predictive value of c-erbB-2 or p53 expression regarding sensitivity to primary chemotherapy or radiotherapy in breast cancer	English	1998	9495354	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9495354	Journal Article	\N	156	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The level of expression of ERBB2 was evaluated by means of CB11 antibody. The percentage of stained infiltrating tumour cells (0%, <1%, 1-5%, 6-25%, 26-50%, >50%) and the intensity of the staining (weak, moderate and strong) were recorded. The final score was determined by combining these 2 parameters: (0) no detectable expression, or expression in less than 5% of the cells whatever the intensity, or in less than 25% of the cells with a weak intensity; (1) weak labelling in more than 25% of cells; (2) moderate or strong labelling in more than 6% of the cells. TP53 immunostaining was evaluated by means of DO7 antibody and classified as strong  (>50% of labelled tumour cells), weak (<50% and >5% of labelled tumour cells) or low (<5% of labelled tumour cells). The proliferative index could be evaluated by means of MIB1 antibody in 326 cases. The result was expressed according to the percentage of labelled tumour cells (>10%, between 5 and 10% or , <5%) and was further classified as high (>10% of labelled tumour cells) or low (<10% of labelled tumour cells).	All patients received primary radiotherapy with a Cobalt-60 unit (54 Gy over 6 weeks to the breast and 45-50 Gy to regional nodes) before surgery, followed by chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	To document whether c-erbB-2 over-expression or p53 accumulation in tumour cells was predictive of response to chemo- or radiotherapy, we analyzed a population of patients with breast cancer assigned to neo-adjuvant therapy (median follow-up: 54 months). T2/T3-N0N1b-M0 tumours (329 cases) were treated either by FAC chemotherapy or by radiotherapy before surgery, and the clinical response was classified as complete or incomplete. Expression of c-erbB-2 and p53 was retrospectively evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Proliferation rate was assessed by means of MIB-1 antibody and by S-phase fraction. A complete response to chemotherapy was observed in 38/167 patients (23%). Complete response rate was 20% in c-erbB-2-negative tumours, and rose to 31% in tumours with c-erbB-2 over-expression, but this trend was not statistically significant. There was no correlation between p53 staining and response to treatment, whereas chemosensitivity was found correlated with histological grade and S-phase. A complete response to radiotherapy was observed in 64 of the 156 evaluable patients (41%). Complete response rate was 41% in c-erbB-2- or p53-negative tumours, 54% in tumours with c-erb-B-2 over-expression, and 44% in tumours with p53 accumulation. There was no correlation between response to radiotherapy and histological grade or proliferative rate. No prognostic value was found for c-erbB-2 or p53 expression, whereas the 5-year survival rate was 85% for patients presenting a tumour with a low proliferating index (MIB-1 < 10%), and 68% for patients presenting a tumour with a high proliferative index. In multivariate analysis, node status (RR = 2), MIB-1 immunostaining (RR = 2), and tumour size (RR = 1.8) were found to be associated with survival. These results indicate that c-erbB-2 or p53 expression is not significantly associated with tumour response to neo-adjuvant chemo/radiotherapy in our series of breast cancers.

The median time elapsed from surgery to adjuvant chemoradiation was 2.9 months (range, 1.3-10.6 months) and the median duration of radiation therapy was 56 days (range, 37-134 days). The median number of administered chemotherapy cycles was 3, and the median overall treatment time (from surgery to the end of adjuvant chemoradiation) was 21 weeks (range, 13-54 weeks).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiation improves survival in HNSCC patients presenting with risk features. ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementation group 1) is associated with resistance to chemo- and radiation therapy and may have a prognostic value in HNSCC patients. Here we studied ERCC1 expression and the polymorphism T19007C as prognostic markers in these patients. This is a retrospective and translational analysis, where ERCC1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, using an H-score, and mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR. T19007C genotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP carried out using DNA template extracted from normal lymph nodes. A high H-score was seen in 32 patients (54%), who presented better 5-year overall survival (5-y OS: 50% vs. 18%, HR 0.43, p=0.026). Fifteen out of 45 patients (33%), with high mRNA expression, presented better 5-year overall survival (OS) (86% vs. 30%, HR 0.26, p=0.052). No OS difference was detected among T19007C genotypes. High H-score and mRNA expression remained significant as favorable prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis. Collectively, our results suggest that high ERCC1 expression seems to be associated with better OS rates in HNSCC patients submitted to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemoradiation.

321	Bax expression as a prognostic marker of postoperative chemoradiotherapy for patients with esophageal cancer	English	2001	11254884	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11254884	Journal Article	\N	57	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The specimen was decided as Bax-positive when more than 75% of cancer cells showed unequivocal and strong immunoreaction as described previously. We decided that tumors with more than 50% of tumor cells showing strong nuclear reactivity of TP53 were TP53-positive.	The radiation treatment was performed in the thoracic field. Multifield techniques were used to limit the total dose of radiation to normal structures. The daily fractional dose of radiation was 2 Gy, given 5 days a week. Patients received a total dose of 30-68 Gy in 5-7 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered during the same period as the radiation therapy using cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil. The complete chemotherapy program consisted of three cycles of intravenous administration of 5-fluorouracil, 250 mg/㎡ per day for 5 days, and cisplatin, 20 mg/㎡ per day for one day with adequate hydration. Radiochemotherapy was interrupted when the granulocyte count fell below 3000/m³.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Postoperative chemoradiotherapy was introduced to improve the survival of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, considerable number of patients still die of cancer recurrence despite curative operation plus chemoradiotherapy. This indicates that some ESCCs are chemoradio-resistant. To prevent unnecessary treatment and to improve the effect of post-operative adjuvant therapy, it seems to be important to investigate biological markers of chemoradio-sensitivity in ESCC. Loss of Bax expression has been reported to be associated with poor response to chemotherapy in breast cancer, and Bax promotes apoptosis in cells. Abnormal expression of Bax may play an important role in chemoradio-sensitivity in malignant tumors. In this study, we retrospectively investigated the prognostic significance of the expressions of Bax and p53 in patients with ESCC. Immunoreactivities of Bax and p53 were evaluated in 141 surgically resected ESCC by using monoclonal antibodies. Prognoses of 141 patients with or without postoperative chemoradiotherapy were compared among groups with high and low expressions of Bax or p53. High immunoreactivities of Bax and p53 were detected in 49 cases (33.1%) and in 70 cases (47.3%), respectively. Loss of Bax expression was detected more frequently in p53-positive tumors. Bax expression correlated with favorable prognosis (P=0.016) in 57 patients with postoperative chemoradiotherapy. However, in 84 patients without adjuvant therapy, the prognostic significance of Bax was minimal. Moreover, in patients with or without postoperative chemoradiotherapy, p53 expression did not correlate with the prognosis. Bax expression may be a good marker for chemoradio-sensitivity in patients with ESCC.	International Journal of Molecular Medicine	\N
322	The prognostic significance of the p53 overexpression on complete response and survival in preoperative chemoradiotherapy treated squamous cell esophageal carcinoma	Korean	1998	\N	https://www.e-crt.org/journal/view.php?number=1090#	Journal Article	\N	42	37	5	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of p53 overexpression and to analyse the relationship between p53 overexpression and complete response rate, survival in locoregionl squamous cell esophageal cancers treated with preoperative chemoradiation multimodality approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a microwave oven heating method, we have detected p53 overexpression by immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody(DO-7) in formalin- fixed paraffin-embedded samples of 42 patients with locoregional squamous cell esophageal cancer, who treated with concurrent chemotherapy and radiatian followed by surgery. RESULTS: In 27 of 42 tumors(64.2%), nuclear immunoreactivity for the p53 protein was detected. Complete response rate, evaluated in surgical specimen 3-4 weeks after chemoradiation seemed to be high in p53 positive group compared to p53 negative group, however, there was no statistically significant difference in acquiring better complete response rate, overall survival and progression free survival between p53 positive and p53 negative group(p=0.0546, p=0.0599, p= 0.6832). Complete response group(n=17) survived longer than non-complete response group(n=25)(p=0.0010).  CONCLUSION: The results indicate that p53 is not a statistically significant prognostic factor in obtaining better complete response rate, overall survival and progression free survival of the patients with esophageal carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Additional studies are warranted for further evaluation.	Journal of the Korean Cancer Association	\N
323	Concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer: prognostic significanceof low expression of bax	English	2006	17013542	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17013542	Journal Article	\N	35	26	9	47	\N	[19.0,64.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy was administered on linear accelerator. Patients were treated 5 days per week in daily radiation dose of 2 Gy with single fraction per day. Total dose to primary tumor was 70 Gy in 7 weeks. Primary tumor was irradiated with 6MV X-ray using conventional bilateral portals or multiple portals of conformal or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques. Some patients were treated with conventional bilateral portals initially followed by boost dose of 10-16 Gy with conformal or IMRT techniques. When using 3 dimensional radiotherapy techniques such as conformal or IMRT, physician’s tumor volume included gross tumor volume and nasopharynx proper with 0.5-1 cm margin. We did not limitthe radiation dose to inner ear structure on radiation treatment planning. Forty-four to 50Gy of radiation was delivered for elective neck treatment. After completion of diagnostic procedures, patients were treated by induction chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 1,000 mg/㎡/day and cisplatin 20 mg/㎡/day continuous intravenous infusion days 1-4. CCRT started on day 22 consisting of RT with cisplatin 20mg/㎡/day continuous infusion for 4 days during weeks 1, 4, and 7 of RT. After completion of CCRT, two cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen as in the induction chemotherapy were given if possible.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	A randomized trial has demonstrated that concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is superior to radiotherapy (RT) alone in locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Our study comprise 35 patients with locally advanced NPC (stage I: 1, II: 12, III: 7, IV: 15) with 1 cycle of induction chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m(2)/day and cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/day, days 1- 4) followed by concurrent CRT starting on day 22. Concurrent CRT consisted of RT (70 Gy/35 fractions for 7 weeks) with cisplatin 20 mg/m(2)/day for 4 days on weeks 1, 4, 7 of RT. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 33 patients (94%). Four-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients were 57% and 65%, respectively. In analysis of prognostic factors, low expression of bax was the most significant independent predictor of poor prognosis in both PFS (p=0.002) and OS (p=0.008). In conclusion, the outcome of patients treated with this combined therapeutical modality appears to be comparable with that of Intergroup 0099 trial with high CR rate. Low expression of bax was significantly associated with poor PFS and OS.	Neoplasma	Stage I: 1 patient, Stage II: 12 patients, Stage III: 7 patients, Stage IV: 15 patients.
324	Expression of VEGF and HIF-1α in locally advanced cervical cancer: potential biomarkers for predicting preoperative radiochemotherapy sensitivity and prognosis	English	2016	27284254	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27284254	Journal Article	\N	43	\N	43	\N	49.8800000000000026	[36.0,68.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Intravenous chemotherapy was first introduced on day 1. The chemotherapy regimen utilized an intravenous infusion of paclitaxel (135 mg/㎡) and nedaplatin (80 mg/㎡). Three days following chemotherapy, after-loading intracavitary brachytherapy was performed using an 192 Ir high-dose-rate after-loading brachytherapy machine at an 8 Gy dose. Clinical evaluations were conducted weekly during the treatment. Patients with no response or disease progression were treated with radical radiotherapy, whereas patients with a response underwent radical hysterectomy 2 weeks post radiotherapy. Both ovaries were retained for patients younger than 45 years old.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is an early-stage cervical cancer characterized by a local tumor diameter of ≥4 cm. Patients with LACC have a relatively poor prognosis. Although preoperative radiochemotherapy (PRCT) might offer a valuable opportunity for subsequent radical surgery, surgeons should also consider the nonresponsive rate, the adverse effects of PRCT, and the surgical complications before designing a treatment plan. Therefore, biomarkers for predicting PRCT sensitivity and prognosis in patients with LACC are of high importance. We investigated the prognostic significance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in patients with LACC. A total of 43 patients with LACC who underwent PRCT (one course each of intravenous chemotherapy and after-loading intracavitary brachytherapy followed by a radical hysterectomy) during the period 2009-2014 were included in this study. VEGF and HIF-1α expression levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry in LACC lesions before and after PRCT. In addition, we analyzed the association of these proteins with the clinical response and pathological findings of pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) after the subsequent surgery. The total clinical response rate was 81.39% after PRCT, including five complete responses and 30 partial responses. VEGF and HIF-1α expression before PRCT was significantly higher than after PRCT (VEGF: 85.71% vs 66.67%; HIF-1α: 83.33% vs 59.52%, P<0.05). In addition, the same trend was found in patients with PLNM compared to those without PLNM (VEGF: 100% vs 77.78%; HIF-1α: 100% vs 74.07%, P<0.05). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.896 and 0.835 when using pre-PRCT VEGF and HIF-1α expression levels, respectively, to diagnose PLNM in patients with LACC. Serial detection of VEGF and HIF-1α demonstrated a sensitivity of 66.67% and specificity of 88.89%. These findings suggest that VEGF and HIF-1α expressions are potential biomarkers for PRCT and have great clinical significance for the prediction of PRCT response and prognosis in patients with LACC.

None of the patients underwent surgery. In an additional cohort of 14 patients treated prospectively with radiotherapy alone, biopsies of the primary tumor were performed, either endoscopically or directly, 1 day before and immediately after the delivery of 20 Gy of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (15 days after the beginning of fractionated radiotherapy). These patients were not included in the response and survival analysis. Six of these patients suffered from nasopharyngeal, 3 hypopharyngeal, 1 laryngeal, and 4 oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas. The biopsy material from these patients was used to assess the changes induced by radiotherapy in the patterns of vascularization and of TP cancer cell expression. Thirty-eight patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy, followed by radical radiotherapy (LINAC 6 MV or Cobalt 60 Unit; 2 Gy/fraction; five fractions/week; total tumor dose, 70 Gy). Fifty-six patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (same radiotherapy regimen). None of the patients underwent surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Thymidine phosphorylase (TP), an enzyme involved in the thymidine synthesis and degradation, has been shown to promote tumor angiogenesis. Both TP expression and tumor vascularization are putative postoperative prognostic markers of cancer. Because of its bifunctional role, TP may have interactions with cytotoxic drugs or radiation via pathways requiring thymidine or prodrug activation. The microvessel score and TP expression were examined immunohistochemically on paraffin-embedded bioptical material from 94 locally advanced squamous cell head and neck carcinomas. All patients were treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy combined with induction (platinum- and 5-fluorouracil-based) or concurrent platinum chemotherapy. The follow-up of patients ranged from 6 to 108 months (median, 48 months). Nuclear TP expression was significantly associated with increased microvessel score (P < 0.0001, r = 0.45). A low percentage of cancer cells with nuclear TP expression in pretreatment biopsies was associated with a high rate of CR after combined chemoradiotherapy (P = 0.006) and induction chemotherapy (0.01). A better local relapse-free and overall survival was also observed in these patients (P = 0.001 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Biospies on the day after the delivery of 20 Gy of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy showed residual cancer cell nests, frequently of high vascularization and of intense nuclear TP reactivity. It is concluded that thymidine phosphorylase is associated with angiogenesis, with resistance to radiotherapy and cytotoxic therapy, and with poorer survival in squamous cell head and neck cancer. A strong rationale is provided for subsequent clinical trials of concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with antiangiogenic agents or with specific TP inhibitors.

Intensity of PTGS2 staining was graded on a scale of 0 to 3+, with 0 representing no detectable stain and 3+ representing the strongest stain (1 = weak, 2 = moderate, 3 = strong). The raw data were converted to the IHS by adding the quantity and intensity staining scores. Theoretically, the scores could range from 0 to 6. Because of limited case numbers, we modified the Soslow staging system so as to allocate patients to two groups instead of four. An IHS score of 3 to 6 was considered as high expression and 0 to 2 (0 + 0 or 1 + 1) as low (or no) expression.	All received potentially curative doses of radiation (range, 5880-8160 cGy; mean dose, 7252 cGy) using similar methods. The nasopharyngeal tumor, local extension sites, and entire neck lymphatics were irradiated with 6-MV x-ray to a total dose of 4680 cGy/26 fractions by means of bilateral opposing and separate single anterior low-neck fields, followed by a boost to the primary tumor to the desired total dose. The posterior neck lymph nodes were boosted by electrons to the desired dose according to the lymph node status of the patient. One patient did not complete the radiation treatment, and only 5880 cGy was delivered to the tumor. Another patient was entered into a hyperfractionated protocol and received a radiation dose of 8160 cGy (120 cGy twice daily treatment) to the nasopharynx. The other 35 patients received a homogeneous radiation dose ranging from 7020 to 7480 cGy. Only five patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. Two of these received induction chemotherapy with PF regimen (cisplatin and 5-FU). Two received concurrent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine the status of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) in Taiwanese patients and its relationship to survival after radiotherapy (RT). In addition, the effect of NS-398, a potent selective COX-2 inhibitor, was tested in vitro alone and in combination with radiation on NPC-BM1 human NPC cells as a prelude to using this drug along with RT in the treatment of patients with NPC. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients diagnosed with T4N0-3M0 NPC were enrolled into this study. COX-2 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Patient survival was the clinical end point. The effects of COX-2 expression on cell survival and radioresistance was tested in vitro using the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 in conjunction with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazonium bromide (MTT) and clonogenic assays. RESULTS: COX-2 immunoreactivity was detected in 62% of NPC tumors, and expression levels were high in 43%. Survival analysis showed the 5-year overall survival rates for patients who had high COX-2 expression was 27% compared with 60% for those with low/absent expression (p = .047). Pattern of failure analysis showed no significant difference between high and low COX-2 expression in locoregional failure (27% vs 25%, p = .91). However, patients with N0 to N1 disease and high COX-2 expression had a significantly higher incidence of distant metastasis compared with patients with stage N0 to N1 disease and low COX-2 expression (83% vs 15%, p = .004). This difference was not observed in patients with N2 to N3 disease. This difference contributed to worse survival of patients whose tumors had high COX-2 expression levels. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 was directly cytotoxic to NPC-BM1 cells in vitro, as judged in an MTT assay (viable cells decreased from 92% to 76%, 52%, and 22%, with increases of NS-398 from 20 to 40, 60, and 80 microM, respectively). Radiation-induced cell death was also increased by treatment with NS-398. At a 10% survival level, 40 microM NS-398 increased radiation cytotoxicity by a factor of 1.37, whereas 60 microM increased it by a factor of 4.9. CONCLUSIONS: COX-2 overexpression is a predictor for poor survival for advanced stage NPC. In vitro, NS-398 radiosensitizes the NPC-BM1 cell line, providing a basis for testing the combination of COX-2 inhibitors with radiation in the treatment of patients with NPC.

327	Expression modes and clinical manifestations of latent membrane protein 1, Ki-67, cyclin-B1, and epidermal growth factor receptor in nonendemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2009	19132724	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19132724	Journal Article	\N	45	28	17	56	\N	[11.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Overexpression of MKI67 was defined as a value greater than or equal to the median LI (labeling index) of the population. A cutoff value of ≥15% was set for CCNB1 overexpression, which almost corresponded to its median LI in the whole series. For EGFR immunoractivity, both the extent and the intensity of the staining were evaluated. EGFR overexpression was defined as EGFR expression with an LI ≥50%.	External irradiation with curative intent was delivered to all patients and 37 patients additionally received intracavitary brachytherapy as boost treatment. The median total irradiation dose for the whole population was 68.2 (range, 54-74.6) Gy. Thirty-two patients also received chemotherapy mostly as induction therapy, which included 1 to 3 cycles of cisplatin-fluorouracil delivered every third week. Table 1 presents the demographic, clinical, and survival data for the patients. For evaluation of the treatment response, a follow-up program was scheduled 6 to 8 weeks after termination of radiation and then every 3 to 4 months for the first 2 years and every 6 months up to 5 years.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify clinical significance of latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), Ki-67, cyclin-B1, and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), in nonendemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: The relation between expression of the markers in 45 NPC specimens and clinicopathological and survival variables was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: LMP1 was present in 33% of the tumors, and its presence was associated with advanced nodal and disease stages. Overexpression was defined as labeling index > or = median value for Ki-67, > or = 15% for cyclin-B1, and > or =50% for EGFR, and it was displayed in 50%, 55%, and 80% of the specimens, respectively. Strong EGFR staining intensity and not overexpression of the 3 markers was the variable with statistically significant impact on treatment outcomes in terms of worse local and locoregional tumor control rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the evaluation of EGFR staining intensity in patients with NPC may identify a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis.

328	nm23-H1 expression in nasopharyngeal carcinoma: correlation with clinical outcome	English	1998	9842967	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9842967	Journal Article	\N	78	57	21	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	According to the stained products of NME1 located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells as yellow-brown granules, a 2-point scale was used in the assessment as follows: negative (-), no significant tumor-cell staining; positive (+), cytoplasmic tumor-cell staining.	All patients received radical radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy	5	The expression levels of nm23-H1 mRNA and its protein in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) were detected to clarify the relationship between nm23-H1 and metastasis and prognosis of patients with NPC. nm23-H1 mRNA expression in fresh tissues from 78 patients with NPC was investigated by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. Routine labeling streptavidin-biotin immuno-histochemistry with the nm23-H1 murine monoclonal antibody was employed to study the expression of nm23-H1 protein in paraffin-embedded specimens from 231 patients with NPC treated in our hospital. The clinical pathologic data and results of follow-up were collected. Comparisons between expression of nm23-H1 protein or mRNA and clinical outcome were performed using the chi2 test. Multivariate prognostic analyses were performed by the Cox regression model. We found that nm23-H1-negative tumors were associated with a higher incidence of lymph-node metastasis (84.2%) than nm23-H1-positive ones (32.8%, p < 0.01). The distant metastasis and loco-regional recurrence rates in the nm23-H1-negative group were 55.8% and 31.68%, respectively but only 17.2% and 11.5%, respectively, in the nm23-H1-positive group (p < 0.01). A significant association was found between expression of nm23-H1 protein and prognosis (p < 0.01). Expression of nm23-H1 protein indicated favorable prognosis, suggesting that the absence of nm23-H1 protein expression was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis, recurrence and distant metastasis in NPC. Expression of the nm23-H1 gene may be valuable for assessing the prognosis of NPC.	International Journal of Cancer	Stage I-II: 31 patients, Stage III-IV: 47 patients.

Radiation was performed five times a week with 2 Gy at each session. The mean dose was 29.5 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	This study was carried out to elucidate whether apoptosis and p53 can be used to stratify oral cancer patients into groups with a favorable or unfavorable response to preoperative radiation therapy. Thirty-two patients were evaluated. The apoptosis index was 1.7+/-0. 9% in the ineffective cases, and it was significantly lower than effective cases (3.2+/-1.2%). While 14 of 16 effective cases (86.7%) did not express p53, 13 of 16 ineffective cases (81.3%) overexpressed p53. These results suggest that mutated p53 in tumors is associated with a poor response to radiation which may be related to evasion of apoptosis in oral cancer.

330	Cyclooxygenase 2 expression in rectal cancer is of prognostic significance in patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy	English	2007	17504996	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17504996	Journal Article	\N	510	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Sore 0, no staining; score 1, weak diffuse cytoplasmatic staining (may contain stronger intensity in <10% of the cancer cells); score 2, moderate to strong granular cytoplasmatic staining in 10-90% of the tumor cells; and score 3, >90% of the tumor cells stained with strong intensity. In the present study, PTGS2 scores 0, 1, and 2 were defined as PTGS2 low, and a score of 3 was defined as PTGS2 high.	Patients with a resectable carcinoma of the rectum were included in this international multicenter clinical trial and were subsequently randomized for radiotherapy (5 x 5 Gy) followed by TME surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To determine the effect of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression on clinical behavior in irradiated and nonirradiated rectal carcinomas. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor samples were collected from 1,231 patients of the Dutch TME trial, in which rectal cancer patients were treated with standardized surgery and randomized for preoperative short-term (5 x 5 Gy) radiotherapy or no preoperative radiotherapy. Tissue microarrays were constructed from primary tumor material, and COX-2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Tumor cell apoptosis was determined by M30 immunostaining. RESULTS: A high level of COX-2 expression after radiotherapy was associated with low levels of tumor cell apoptosis (P=0.001). COX-2 expression had no significant effect on patient survival or tumor recurrence in nonirradiated tumors. However, in patients receiving preoperative radiotherapy, high level of COX-2 expression was associated with higher incidence of distant recurrences [P=0.003; hazard ratio (HR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2-2.5] and shorter disease-free survival (P=0.002; HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5) and overall survival (P=0.009; HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.0), independent of patient age, tumor stage, tumor location, or the presence of tumor cells in the circumferential resection margin. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of COX-2 expression after preoperative radiotherapy in resection specimens is associated with apoptosis resistance, high distant recurrence rates, and a poor prognosis in rectal cancer.

346	Prognostic significance of cyclin D1 and p16 in patients with intermediate-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with docetaxel and concurrent radiotherapy	English	2007	17563903	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563903	Journal Article	\N	53	49	4	62	61	[43.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	A tumor was considered CCND1-positive if more than 10% of the tumor cells demonstrated positive nuclear staining for CCND1. We considered a tumor with more than 1% of cells demonstrating CDKN2A nuclear staining as CDKN2A-positive. 	Radiotherapy was administered at a dose of 2.5 Gy (2 Gy to tumors of the hypopharynx) 4 times a week up to a total of 40 Gy. The response of the primary and nodal tumors at 40 Gy was evaluated by radiation oncologists and otolaryngologists. Patients with a primary tumor that demonstrated a strong response at 40 Gy were advised to receive radical radiotherapy treatment up to a total dose of 65 to 67 Gy. Surgical resection was used for the remaining patients with a weaker tumor response, providing the tumor was resectable and the patients agreed to the treatment. Nodal metastasis was treated with radiotherapy alone Cyclin D1 and p16 Expression in HNSCC if the nodal response was deemed to be strong. Otherwise, the nodes were surgically removed if they were resectable and if the patient consented. Docetaxel was administered once a week for the ﬁrst 4 weeks of radiotherapy treatment. A dose of 10 mg/㎡ of the body surface in 250 mL of 5% glucose was administered intravenously 1 hour before radiotherapy. Patients treated with radical radiotherapy received a total of 5 or 6 weekly docetaxel doses. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, salvage surgery was performed, where possible for residual or recurrent locoregional disease.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The current study aimed to evaluate the significance of the cell-cycle-control proteins cyclin D1 and p16 as prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with docetaxel and radiotherapy. METHODS: Cyclin D1 and/or p16 protein expression was retrospectively evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 53 patients with stage T1-3N0-2M0 (except T1N0 glottis) HNSCC who were treated with 10 mg/m(2)/week docetaxel 4 to 6 times and received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis revealed that patients with cyclin D1-positive tumors or p16-negative tumors had a worse prognosis compared with those with cyclin D1-negative tumors or p16-positive tumors (p = .0004 and p = .025, respectively). The prognostic significance of cyclin D1 expression, not p16 expression, was confirmed using a proportional hazard regression model. CONCLUSIONS: An assessment of cyclin D1 and p16 levels might be of clinical use in defining subgroups of patients with poor prognosis.	Head & Neck	Stage I-II: 22 patients, Stage III-IV: 31 patients.
331	Molecular markers predict outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after concomitant cisplatin-based chemoradiation	English	2009	19253368	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19253368	Journal Article	\N	91	70	21	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Briefly, treatment consisted of 4 consecutive weekly selective intra-arterial infusions of cisplatin (150 mg/㎡) simultaneous with intravenous sodium thiosulfate rescue combined with radiotherapy (2 Gy per day, 5/week 3 7 to a total dose of 70 Gy) according to the RADPLAT protocol.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Not all patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) benefit from concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation, but reliable predictive markers for outcome after chemoradiation are scarce. We have investigated potential prognostic biomarkers for outcome in a large group of patients. Ninety-one tumor biopsies taken from consecutive HNSCC patients were evaluated for protein expression on a tissue microarray. Using immunohistochemistry, 18 biomarkers, involved in various cellular pathways were investigated. Univariable and multivariable proportional hazard analyses were performed to investigate associations between each individual marker and outcome. In addition, the global test was used to test all variables simultaneously and selected combinations of markers for an overall association with local control. Univariable analysis showed statistically significant increased relative risks of RB, P16 and MRP2 for local control and MDR1 and HIF-1alpha for overall survival. MRP2, MDR1 and P16 levels were positively associated with outcome whereas RB and HIF-1alpha had a negative relationship. Using Goeman's global testing no combination of markers was identified that was associated with local control. Grouping the markers according to their function revealed an association between a combination of 3 markers (P16, P21 and P27) and outcome (p = 0.05) was found. In the multivariable analysis, MRP2 and RB remained significant independent predictive markers for local control. This study describes the prognostic value of biomarkers for the outcome in patients uniformly treated with concurrent chemoradiation. MRP2 and RB were found to be associated with outcome in patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation.	International Journal of Cancer	Stage III: 7 patients, Stage IV: 84 patients.
332	Fibronectin overexpression is associated with latent membrane protein 1 expression and has independent prognostic value for nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24081675	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24081675	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Those cases with H-scores larger than the median value were construed as demonstrating fibronectin overexpression.	All the 124 patients were regularly monitored after radiotherapy until death or their last appointment, with the mean follow-up duration being 67.0 months (range, 3-141). Nevertheless, seven patients treated in the earlier phase of this cohort were not available to obtain instantaneous image studies after therapy as a baseline for treatment response evaluation. Another 117 patients received a complete course of radiotherapy (total dose ≧7,000 cGy), and those with stage II-IV disease also received cisplatin-based chemotherapy, based on published protocols.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Despite recent improvements in the diagnosis and treatment, the final outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) still remain suboptimal. Through data mining from published transcriptomic database with further bioinformatic validation, fibronectin (FN1) was identified as a differentially upregulated gene in NPC tissues, which implicates the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype (EMT) and promotes metastasis. Given the roles of fibronectin in risk stratification and in the frontline therapeutics of common carcinomas, such as renal cell cancer, we explored fibronectin immunoexpression status and its associations with clinicopathological variables and survival in a well-defined cohort of NPC patients. Fibronectin immunohistochemistry was retrospectively performed and analyzed using H-score for 124 biopsy specimens from NPC patients who received standard treatment without distant metastasis at initial diagnosis. Those cases with H-score higher than the median value were regarded as fibronectin overexpression. The findings were correlated with clinicopathological variables, EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) expression, disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Fibronectin overexpression was significantly associated with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages III-IV (p = 0.019) and LMP1 expression (p = 0.004), and univariately predictive of adverse outcomes for DSS, DMFS, and LRFS (all p < 0.0001). In the multivariate comparison, fibronectin overexpression still remained prognostically independent to portend worse DSS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.958), DMFS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.728), and LRFS (p < 0.01, hazard ratio = 5.411) together with a vanced AJCC stages III-IV. Fibronectin is upregulated in a subset of NPCs, and its increased immunoexpression significantly correlated with advanced features, justifying the potentiality of fibronectin as a theragnostic biomaker of NPC.

333	Overexpression of stathmin 1 confers an independent prognostic indicator in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24218338	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24218338	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors with H-scores greater than the median of all cases were regarded as high expression.	All patients with follow-up for outcome (n=124) have received the complete course of radiotherapy (total dose≥7,000 cGy) and also cisplatin-based chemotherapy in those with stages II−IV diseases, based on the previously published protocol.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Data mining on public domain identified that stathmin 1 (STMN1) transcript was significantly higher expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Also known as the oncoprotein 18, STMN1 performs an important function in regulating rapid microtubule remodeling of the cytoskeleton in response to the cellular conditions. Immunoexpression of STMN1 was retrospectively assessed in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and treated with consistent guidelines. The outcome was correlated with clinicopathological features and patient survivals. Results indicated that high STMN1 expressions (50 %) were correlated with advanced age (p = 0.027), higher T stage (p = 0.003), and overall clinical stage (p = 0.006) by the 7th American Joint Committee of Cancer Staging. In multivariate analyses, high STMN1 expression emerged as an independent prognosticator for worse disease-specific survival (p = 0.001), distal metastasis-free survival (p = 0.003), and local recurrence-free survival (p = 0.006). Exogenous expression of E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) or/and its dimeric partner, transcription factor Dp-1 (TFDP1), notably induced the STMN1 protein level in a NPC-derived cell line, TW01. Accordingly, high STMN1 protein level is commonly associated with adverse prognosticators and confers tumor aggressiveness in patients with NPC, and its upregulation might be attributed to E2F1 and/or TFDP1 transactivation.

334	Significance of p16 expression in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and cetuximab	English	2014	24715244	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24715244	Journal Article	\N	78	60	18	66	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	EGFR expression was defined as high if the percentage of cells characterized by intense staining (score 3) was ≥ 70 %. For statistical analysis, samples were scored as CDKN2A positive if at least 90 % of the cells (the sum of percentages) stained at least moderate and/or strong.	Out of 78 eligible patients, 58 received standard fractionation radiotherapy (RT), whereas 20 patients were treated with accelerated fractionation RT plus cetuximab. Standard fractionation RT consisted of the delivery of 70 Gy in 35 fractions (2 Gy per fraction, over a 7-week period). By contrast, the accelerated-fractionation RT consisted of 72 Gy given in 42 fractions over a 6-week period plus a concomitant boost comprising twice-daily irradiation (1.8 Gy and 1.5 Gy) for 12 treatment days. The total dose delivered was either 70 Gy or 72 Gy to sites of gross disease and 50 Gy or 54 Gy to adjacent lymphatic drainage regions at risk for subclinical metastasis. The spinalcord dose was limited to a maximum of 46 Gy. The historical control group was treated with the concomitant boost protocol without cetuximab (before the approval of cetuximab for the treatment of head and neck cancer patients in 2006). The administration of intravenous cetuximab (Erbitux(R)), Merck KGA, Darmstadt, Deutschland) was initiated 1 week before the start of RT at a loading dose of 400 mg/㎡ of body-surface area over 120 min, followed by 60-min infusions of 250 mg/㎡ for the duration of RT (one infusion per week). Furthermore, all patients received intravenously cortisone and H1 blockers (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) before the first three to four infusions of cetuximab. Dose modification options for grade 3 skin toxicity included a 1-week delay, with dose reductions in increments of 50 mg/㎡ (minimum cetuximab dose 150 mg/㎡).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: HPV-infection, p16 positivity, and EGFR expression have been correlated with favorable responses of head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy. However, a possible correlation of HPV/p16 and EGFR status on the effect of RT in combination with cetuximab has not been sufficiently investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed tumor samples for p16 and EGFR expression and correlated these variables with treatment outcome. Cox-proportional-hazard regression models were applied to compare the risk of death among patients stratified according to risk factors. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results were compared with an institutional historical control group treated without cetuximab and with published data. RESULTS: Expression of p16 was predominantly found in oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer patients (OPSCC; 36.6% positivity; 92% of all cases), while EGFR was expressed at high levels in all tumor subsites (82%). p16 expression was associated with improved overall survival in irradiated OPSCC patients (2-year overall survival of 80% in p16-positive vs. 33% overall survival in p16-negative patients). In a multivariable analysis covering all tumor sites, nodal stage (> N2a vs. ≤ N2a) and tumor site (OPSSC vs. non-OPSCC) had an impact on overall survival. CONCLUSION: Our results show that p16 positivity is associated with a favorable outcome in OPSCC patients treated with RT and cetuximab.

335	Overexpression of synuclein-γ predicts lack of benefit from radiotherapy for breast cancer patients	English	2016	27595752	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27595752	Journal Article	\N	82	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	According to our previous publications, the grading system was based on a 4value classification scale as follows: the area of staining was graded as <10 % (0) or >10 % (1) of all cancer cells stained within the section; intensity of staining was graded as none (0), weak (1), moderate (2) or strong (3). The final grade was obtained by adding area grade and intensity grade together, and final grade ≥ 3 was defined as positive.	Patients were treated with standard radiotherapy in 25 fractions (50 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week), and ensured that the radiotherapy dose was actually delivered to the CTV (clinical target volume) with 6 MV photons or electron beam.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Although radiotherapy following mastectomy was demonstrated to reduce the recurring risk and improve the prognosis of patients with breast cancer, it is also notorious for comprehensive side effects, hence only a selected group of patients can benefit. Therefore, the screening of molecular markers capable of predicting the efficacy of radiotherapy is essential. METHODS: We have established a cohort of 454 breast cancer cases and selected 238 patients with indications for postoperative radiotherapy. Synuclein-γ (SNCG) protein levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and SNCG status was retrospectively correlated with clinical features and survival in patients treated or not treated with radiotherapy. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and survival analysis for online datasets were also performed for further validation. RESULTS: Among patients that received radiotherapy (82/238), those demonstrating positive SNCG expression had a 55.0 month shorter median overall survival (OS) in comparison to those demonstrating negative SNCG expression (78.4 vs. 133.4 months, log rank χ (2)  = 16.13; p < 0.001). Among the patients that received no radiotherapy (156/238), SNCG status was not correlated with OS (log rank χ (2)  = 2.40; p = 0.121). A COX proportional hazard analysis confirmed SNCG as an independent predictor of OS, only for patients who have received radiotherapy. Similar results were also obtained for distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). A GSEA analysis indicated that SNCG was strongly associated with genes related to a radiation stress response. A survival analysis was performed with online databases consisting of breast cancer, lung cancer, and glioblastoma and further confirmed SNCG's significance in predicting the survival of patients that have received radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: A positive SNCG may serve as a potential marker to identify breast cancer patients who are less likely to benefit from radiotherapy and may also be extended to other types of cancer. However, the role of SNCG in radiotherapy response still needs to be further validated in randomized controlled trials prior to being exploited in clinical practice.

336	Intratumoural level of SDF-1 correlates with survival in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2011	21840752	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21840752	Journal Article	\N	71	59	12	58	60	[42.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Forty-two patients (59%) were treated by surgery followed by radiation therapy, and 27 patients (38%) were treated by surgery followed by concomitant radio-chemotherapy. The median delay between surgery and radiation therapy was 5 weeks (range 4-10). The radiation therapy had a range of doses from 50 Gy (prophylactic irradiation of clinically non-invaded nodes) to 70 Gy (invaded margins after surgery or extracapsular spread). Post-operative chemotherapy was based on a platinum regimen (cisplatin 100 mg/㎡ day 1-22-43 for 20 patients and carboplatin AUC5 day 1-22-43 for seven patients with chronic renal failure).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway has been suggested to play a role in the metastatic dissemination of various tumours. We assessed the prognostic impact of SDF-1 and CXCR4 expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Seventy-one HNSCC samples collected at the time of initial diagnosis were retrospectively analysed. SDF-1 and CXCR4 expression levels were measured using real-time RT-PCR and correlated to survival. After a median follow-up of 45 months, 25 patients (35%) died of cancer (group D), and 46 patients (65%) were alive or dead without evidence of HSNCC evolution (group A). The median level of CXCR4 expression was 0.33 and 0.29 in groups A and D, respectively (P=0.93), showing no correlation with recurrence or survival. By contrast, the median level of SDF-1 expression was significantly different in the A and D groups (2.41 vs 1.16, respectively, P=0.018). Using the median level as a cut-off, patients with low SDF-1 had poorer metastasis-free (P=0.026), disease-free (P=0.006) and overall specific survival rates (P=0.002). The prognostic value of SDF-1 was confirmed by a multivariate analysis. In this series of 71 HNSCC patients, the SDF-1 expression level correlated significantly with metastatic evolution and overall survival.

337	Prognostic role of MMP-9 expression in head and neck carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy	English	2013	23122824	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23122824	Journal Article	\N	105	92	13	63.7000000000000028	\N	[38.2,92.3)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy consisted of total doses of 65-74 Gy to the primary site, 50 Gy to the neck in all patients with N0 nodes (except with T1N0 glottic carcinomas), and 70 Gy to the neck in patients with metastatic neck nodes. Treatment was administered by continuous-course radiotherapy 5 days a week, 2 Gy per session and 1.2 Gy twice daily in normofractionated and hyperfractionated treatments, respectively. Three cycles of cisplatin at a dose of 100 mg/㎡ every 3 weeks were added in patients who received chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-eight patients (26.6%) began treatment with induction chemotherapy. In 21 patients (20%) an elective neck dissection was carried out 4-8 weeks after treatment and radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were completed. The decision to perform an adjuvant neck dissection was based on the initial stage or residual neck disease.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2 and -9 at a transcriptional level in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine mRNA expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in 105 consecutive patients with HNSCC treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. Continuous values of mRNA expression levels were analyzed using a classification and regression tree (CART) method. RESULTS: Patients were grouped into two categories according to the results from CART analysis; high (n=71) and low (n=34) expression levels of MMP-9. MMP-2 expression was not included in the model. The 5-year adjusted survival rate was 92.9% for patients with low MMP-9 expression level and 61.0% for patients with a high expression level (P=0.006). Overexpression of MMP-9 was associated with a decrease in local control of the disease. In a multivariate analysis, MMP-9 expression was the only variable that was associated with adjusted survival. Considering patients with a low MMP-9 expression level as the reference group, patients with a high MMP-9 expression level had a 6.1 times higher risk of death from HNSCC (CI 95%: 1.4-26.4). CONCLUSION: We found a significant relationship between the transcription of MMP-9 and adjusted survival in HNSCC patients treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. These results suggest that MMP-9 transcription may serve as a marker of treatment response to radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy in patients with HNSCC.

338	Bcl2 and human papilloma virus 16 as predictors of outcome following concurrent chemoradiation for advanced oropharyngeal cancer	English	2010	20233885	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20233885	Journal Article	\N	68	58	10	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For BCL2 and BCL2L1, an intensity score (0, absent; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) and a prevalence score (0, <25% of tumor stained; 1, 25-75% stained; 2, >75% stained) were added; a total of three or greater was called positive. CDKN2A expression was scored as positive if strong and diffuse nuclear and cytoplasmic staining was present in ≥70% of the tumor specimen.	Radiotherapy was delivered, generally as intensity-modulated radiation therapy five times weekly in daily fractions of 2 to 2.1 Gy for a total of 33 to 40 fractions. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered either in a high-dose (cisplatin: 100 mg/㎡ i.v. over 1 h every 3 wk for up to three cycles, 12 patients) or in a weekly regimen [carboplatin: area under curve (AUC), 1.5 i.v. over 30 min, 56 patients; typically plus paclitaxel, 45 mg/㎡ i.v. over 30 min, up to seven treatments, 49 patients] as tolerated. One patient receiving cisplatin also received paclitaxel.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) associated with human papilloma virus (HPV) is rapidly growing in incidence. Despite better prognosis than OPSCC associated with traditional risk factors, treatment failure still occurs in a significant proportion of patients. We had identified the antiapoptotic protein Bcl2 as a marker for poor outcome in advanced OPSCC treated with concurrent chemoradiation. To determine whether Bcl2 and HPV together might further characterize treatment response, we examined whether the prognostic value of Bcl2 was independent of HPV status. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment tumor biopsies from 68 OPSCC patients were tested for HPV by in situ hybridization and were immunostained for Bcl2 to evaluate relations with disease-free (DFS) and overall survival following platin-based concurrent chemoradiation. Median follow-up among surviving patients was 47 months (range, 10-131 months). RESULTS: Bcl2 and HPV independently predicted DFS and overall survival. Hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for positive versus negative status in bivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis of DFS were 6.1 (1.8-21) for Bcl2 and 0.11 (0.035-0.37) for HPV. Only 1 of 32 HPV-positive/Bcl2-negative tumors recurred. Pretreatment Bcl2 expression was specifically associated with distant metastasis; five of six distant metastases occurred in the <40% of patients whose primary tumors were Bcl2 positive. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of HPV status, pretreatment Bcl2 expression identifies a subset of OPSCC patients having increased risk of treatment failure, particularly through distant metastasis, after concurrent chemoradiation. Considering HPV and Bcl2 together should help in devising better personalized treatments for OPSCC.	Clinical Cancer Research	Stage II: 1 patient, Stage III: 15 patients, Stage IV: 52 patients.
339	Loss of cyclin D1 and p16 expression correlates with local recurrence in nasopharyngeal carcinoma following radiotherapy	English	2002	12181248	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12181248	Journal Article	\N	65	54	11	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumor were scored CCND1 negative if <5% of tumor cells exhibited nuclear staining and positive if >5% exhibited nuclear staining.

Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The cyclin D1/p16/Rb pathway plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and each component of this pathway may be affected in various malignancies. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of these proteins in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-five patients undergoing radiotherapy for NPC were analyzed. The expression of cyclin D1, p16 and pRb was evaluated with immunohistochemical analysis of archived pretreatment tumor materials and expression of these proteins was correlated with clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Positive expression of cyclin D1 was observed in 43 of 65 NPCs (66%). p16 and pRb inactivation was identified in 42 of 65 (65%) and four of 65 (6%) tumors, respectively. All but seven tumors (58 of 65, 89%) contained at least one alternation in the cyclin D1/p16/Rb pathway. Loss of cyclin D1 as well as p16 was closely related to local recurrence after radiotherapy for NPC (P = 0.015 and 0.047). No association between pRb expression and clinicopathological outcome was apparent. CONCLUSIONS: The study's results suggest that the cyclin D1/p16/Rb pathway plays an important role in NPC tumorigenesis. We also find that cyclin D1 and p16 protein levels in NPC may be of use clinically as a predictor of local tumor control.

340	Analysis of the effect of p16 and tobacco pack-years (p-y) on overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with oropharynx cancer (OPC) in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 9003	English	2010	\N	http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/jco.2010.28.15_suppl.5510	Journal Article	\N	190	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	The RTOG 9003 was a multi-institutional phase III randomized trial which compared 4 different radiation fractionation schemes (standard fractionation, hyperfractionation, accelerated fractionation with split course, or accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost) in the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.	Radiotherapy	5	Background: Differences in OS and PFS were observed for HPV-positive (pos) and negative (neg) OPC patients (pts) treated with chemoradiation in RTOG 0129. We evaluated whether similar differences were observed when OPC pts were treated with radiotherapy alone in RTOG 9003. Methods: An unplanned, retrospective analysis was performed on archived tumor from OPC pts treated in RTOG 9003, a four-arm, phase III trial that compared standard-FX, to hyper-FX, accelerated (A)-FX with split or AFX with concomitant boost. Tumor HPV status for OPC pts was determined by a surrogate, p16 IHC (≥70% expression pos). Five-year OS and PFS were estimated (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) by Kaplan- Meier method and compared by log-rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) for OS (death) and PFS (progression or death) were estimated by Cox models. Results: p16 was evaluable for29% (190/646) of OPC pts and only 39% were pos. OS/PFS outcomes were similar for pts with/without p16 data. p16-pos tumors were associated with better Zubrod PS, absent anemia, and T1 stage, but not assigned treatment. Overall median p-y of tobacco smoking was high (38 p-y), but was lower for the p16-pos group (29 vs. 45.9 p-y, p=0.016). At median f/u of 9.3 years, p16-pos OPC pts had better OS (5-year 49.0 vs. 19.6%, p<0.0001; HR 0.43, 95%CI 0.31-0.61) and PFS (5-year 43.6 vs.19.0%, p<0.0001; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.32-0.63) than p16- neg pts. At 5-years, local-regional failure was lower for p16-pos OPC (30.5 vs. 54.9%, p<0.001) but distant metastases (11.1 vs. 13.0%, p=0.71) and second primary tumors (SPT, 13.8 vs. 11.4%, p=0.40) were not. The hazard of death (OS) or progression and death (PFS) significantly increased by 1% per p-y of tobacco smoking (for both, HR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, p<0.002), after adjustment for Zubrod PS, T stage, N stage and p16. Conclusions: The relative hazard of death or progression for p16-pos vs. neg pts and for p-y of tobacco smoking appears independent of treatment by radiotherapy or chemoradiation. Absolute rates for OS, PFS, and SPT may be compromised in part by higher cumulative p-y of tobacco smoking in pts enrolled a decade before those in RTOG 0129.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	\N
364	Tumour-proliferative fraction and growth factor expression as markers of tumour response to radiotherapy in cancer of the uterine cervix	English	1998	9750023	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9750023	Journal Article	\N	152	\N	152	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Briefly, samples with less than 10% positive cells were considered negative. Samples with 11%-30% were considered as showing mild expression, 30%-50% moderate expression and those with over 51% positive cells as showing intense expression.	All patients in the study received radical radiotherapy (40 Gy in 20 fractions for external-beam ra- diotherapy and 33 Gy to point A by Selectron - ICR).	Radiotherapy	5	This study seeks to define the role of pretreatment of evaluation of tumour growth fraction in cervical cancer and its relationship to the clinical course of the disease. In addition, it also seeks to explain whether cell kinetics and growth factor expression have an association with tumour response to radiotherapy and hence could be of value in the management of patients. All pre-treatment biopsies were analysed for the tumour-proliferative compartment by evaluation of Ki67 antigen expression and argyrophilic nucleolar organiser region (AgNOR) counts. Growth factor analysis was done by analysing for expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) and transforming growth factors alpha and beta (TGFalpha, TGFbeta). A total of 152 patients were evaluated and a correlation obtained between pre-treatment status of the tumour-growth-fraction-associated markers and clinical outcome following radiotherapy. Such patients were either disease-free (group 1, n=106) or with residual/recurrent disease (group 2, n=46) at a 16-month follow-up. Pre-treatment analysis of AgNOR significantly correlated to disease status after treatment (r=-0.517, P=0.0000). This may be due to an effect of cell proliferation. Lower AgNOR counts were significantly associated with recurrent/residual tumours, suggesting that increased proliferative activity may be a positive prognostic indicator. Similar results were also obtained for the other proliferation-associated marker Ki67 (r=-0.443, P=0.0000). Expression of EGF and EGF-R also showed significant pre-treatment correlations with the final disease outcome (r=0.248, P=0.031 and r=0.503, P=0.0000 respectively). Both these markers were expressed more by patients belonging to group 2. The opposite was the case for TGFalpha, where patients belonging to group 1 showed higher values (r=0.417, P=0.0001). The other growth factor investigated, TGFbeta, also showed a conspicuous differential expression in the two groups of patients (r=-0.604, P=0.0000). Group 1 patients showed mostly mild to moderate expression while most group 2 patients were negative for the growth factor. It therefore appears that tumours with high AgNOR counts and Ki67 index, along with expression of the two types of transforming growth factor (alpha and beta), responded better to radiotherapy.

For all statistical tests, the ﬁve grades of staining were reduced to three: weak (0/+); intermediate (++/+++); and strong (++++).	External beam RT (EBRT) was delivered with a 6 or 15-MV linear accelerator to a median total dose of 56 Gy (range 31-67). A four-ﬁeld box technique was used for daily fractions of 1.8 or 2 Gy, ﬁve times weekly. Providing sufﬁcient tumor regression was found after EBRT, high-dose-rate brachytherapy (BT) with 192 Ir was delivered. The median BT dose was 16 Gy given to point A, with a median of four fractions. In 19 of the 78 study patients, BT could not be realized because of persisting tumor mass and/or destruction of the cervix, making intra- cavitary BT impossible. In this case, a higher dose of EBRT was given to 15 of 19 patients to a total dose of 60-66 Gy. The median total dose for all 78 study patients was 69 Gy at point A. Concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy was given in 27 patients (35%), 17 of whom underwent cisplatin monotherapy (20 mg/㎡ on Days 1-5 and 29-33); 10 were treated with additional 5-ﬂuorouracil (1000 mg/㎡ on Days 1-5 and 29-33).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: In the early stages of cervical cancer treated with surgery alone, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (hif-1alpha) expression is prognostic for overall survival. Because hypoxia plays an important role in radiation resistance, we investigated hif-1alpha expression in cervical cancer treated with local radical radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1990 and 1998, 91 patients with squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix were treated with external beam RT with and without brachytherapy. Biopsies from 78 patients were available for immunohistochemistry. The impact of the immunoreactivity of hif-1alpha in regard to survival end points was determined by univariate and multivariate analyses. Correlations with clinicopathologic characteristics were determined by cross-tabulations. RESULTS: Hif-1alpha was expressed in 73 (94%) of 78 patients. It was closely linked to the pretreatment hemoglobin level (p = 0.04, r = -0.22, Spearman correlation test). The Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly shorter local progression-free survival (p = 0.04, log-rank) and overall survival (p = 0.01, log-rank) and a trend for shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.15) for patients with increased hif-1alpha expression. The multivariate analyses revealed hif-1alpha expression to be an independent factor for overall survival (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Hif-1alpha is expressed in the vast majority of patients with advanced cervical cancer and had a prognostic significance. A weak but significant correlation was noted with pretreatment hemoglobin level.

342	Expression of hypoxic-inducible factor 1alpha predicts metastasis-free survival after radiation therapy alone in stage IIIB cervical squamous cell carcinoma	English	2004	15380586	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15380586	Journal Article	\N	38	\N	\N	64	\N	[46.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients in this analysis received radiation therapy alone. In brief, combination therapy with external beam irradiation of the entire pelvis and three sessions of low-dose-rate intracavity brachytherapy was provided to all patients. Prophylactic irradiation for paraaortic lymph nodes was not performed for all cases. The overall treatment time from the initiation of radiotherapy to completion did not exceed 6 weeks. External beam radiation therapy was delivered with a linear accelerator using a 10-MV photon beam at a total dose of 50 Gy applied to the whole pelvis through anteroposterior and posteroanterior opposite ﬁelds. Fractionation was a 2-Gy tumor dose daily, ﬁve fractions per week. A midline shield 3 cm wide at the central axis was inserted when the total dose reached 20 Gy. Intracavity irradiation was administered with cesium-137 by means of a set of applicators called the Ganken applicator modiﬁed from the Manchester system. The standard loading was 20-mg, 20-mg, and 10-mg RaEq sources in tandem and two 20-mg RaEq sources in the vaginal ovoid of 3 cm interdistance. The ﬁrst insertion was carried out after external pelvis irradiation with 20-30 Gy. The second insertion was performed 7-10 days later, and ﬁnal insertion was performed at the completion of external beam irradiation. The dose rate at point A was 0.9-1.2 Gy per hour. The total doses of brachytherapy at point A ranged from 50.4 to 60.9 Gy, with a median dose of 55.6 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is an intrinsic marker of tumor hypoxia. It has been considered that the hypoxic status reduces radiosensitivity, but the role of HIF-1alpha in advanced cervical carcinoma is still unclear. The objective of this study was to clarify the impact of HIF-1alpha, human papillomavirus (HPV), and other molecular factors, such as p53, bax, bcl-2, and their correlations on the outcome of patients with Stage IIIB cervical carcinoma in radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed 38 patients with FIGO Stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with radiation therapy alone. All patients received the combination therapy of external beam irradiation and low-dose-rate intracavity brachytherapy. The tumor expressions of HIF-1alpha, p53, bax, and bcl-2 were examined by immunohistochemical staining of the pretreatment paraffin embedded specimens. HPV infection was also detected by polymerase chain reaction. The effects of these parameters on clinical outcomes were analyzed by univariate analysis. RESULTS: Of 38 patients, high expression of HIF-1alpha, p53, bax, and bcl-2 were seen in 17 (45%), 22 (58%), 15 (39%), and 15 (39%) patients, respectively, and 28 patients (74%) showed positive infection with HPV. There was a significant positive correlation between high HIF-1alpha expression and disease recurrence (p < 0.05). Furthermore, HIF-1alpha had a significant correlation with the recurrence-free survival rate (p = 0.04). No statistical correlation was noted between high HIF-1alpha expression and the local control rate (p = 0.17), whereas the HIF-1alpha status predicted distant metastasis with strong significance (p = 0.03). Conversely, other factors demonstrated no impact on the clinical outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that HIF-1alpha is an important prognostic factor, especially for predicting future metastasis after radiation therapy for patients with Stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative prognostic value of p53, cyclin D1, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. PATIENTS: Fifty-six patients with oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma referred to the Department of Therapeutic Radiology at Yale-New Haven Hospital (Conn) between 1981 and 1992 who were treated with gross total surgical resection and postoperative external beam radiotherapy. RESULTS: Archival tumor tissue was stained with monoclonal antibodies directed against these 4 oncoproteins and scored for staining intensity and percent distribution by a pathologist blinded to the patients' clinical outcomes. Frequency of marker expression was 48% for p53, 20% for cyclin D1, 64% for EGFR, and 41% for VEGF. In multivariate analysis, EGFR positivity was protective against locoregional relapse (relative risk [RR], 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.66; P =.002). In contrast, advanced N stage predicted poor locoregional relapse-free survival (RR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.03-3.66; P =.04). Predictors of poor overall survival in multivariate analysis included VEGF positivity (RR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.75-7.13; P<.001) and black race (RR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.05-5.85; P =.04). Cyclin D1 and p53 expression were not significantly associated with prognosis in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS: In oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy, VEGF and EGFR expression may influence clinical outcome. If confirmed, these results have potential implications for the determination of patient prognosis and the development of biologically based pharmacotherapies.

Tumours were classiﬁed as CDKN2A-positive in the case of strong, diffuse nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining in >70% of carcinoma cells, also taking into consideration the characteristic morphological appearance of HPV-related oropharynx.	In the DAHANCA 5 trial 414 patients were treated with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (66-68 Gy in 33- 34 fx, 5 fx/week) and the patients were randomly assigned to treat- ment with the hypoxic cell radiosensitizer nimorazole or placebo. The trial demonstrated a signiﬁcant improvement in outcome in the nimorazole-arm, compared to placebo. In the DAHANCA 7 trial 786 patients were randomly assigned to either conventional or slightly accelerated radiotherapy (ﬁve or six fractions per week). In addition, patients received nimorazole, based on the results of the DAHANCA 5 trial. The study showed a signiﬁcant beneﬁt in favour of the slightly accelerated 6 fx/week schedule.	Radiotherapy	5	AIM: EGFR and HPV-associated p16 are among the most investigated biomarkers in head and neck cancer. The aim was to investigate the correlation and interaction between these two markers and to evaluate their potential prognostic significance when combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 336 Oropharyngeal carcinomas treated with primary radiotherapy (66-68 Gy, 2fx/day, 10-12 Gy/week) and with known EGFR/p16-status estimated semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry were included in the study. Data were evaluated by EGFR-expression (high/low) and p16-status (positive/negative) consequently dividing tumours into four groups by combination of the biomarkers. Patient/tumour characteristics and complete 5-year follow-up were available. RESULTS: Low EGFR-expression was significantly more common in p16-positive tumours compared to p16-negative, p < 0.0001. p16 positivity showed a strong prognostic impact (p < 0.0001, HR = 0.22 [0.13-0.38]), whereas EGFR was a weak prognostic marker when local control was used as endpoint (p = 0.03, HR = 0.53 [0.29-0.94]). Combination of EGFR/p16 did not add significant information to p16 alone and by multivariable analysis only p16 showed significant prognostic information for all evaluated endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Both EGFR and p16 bear prognostic information in oropharyngeal cancer, although p16 is, by far, the strongest prognostic factor. The markers seem to be correlated and this might have influence when evaluating the effect of EGFR inhibition in oropharyngeal tumours.

Forty-nine patients underwent treatment, while 3 patients declined treatment or were not in a condition for such treatment. Thirty-four patients underwent surgery, none of them as single treatment, thus 49 underwent RT given with a daily fraction of 2 Gy, 5 days weekly, to a total dose of 64 Gy. Twenty-nine of the patients received preoperative RT, 6 patients had postoperative RT and 14 patients had RT as a single treatment modality.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) in tonsillar carcinoma is correlated with favourable clinical outcome. Here, p16(INK4A), in situ HPV DNA hybridisation (ISH) and HPVL1 capsid detection were evaluated in tonsillar carcinoma to predict the response to radiotherapy (RT) and prognosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-one pre-treatment paraffin-embedded tonsillar cancer biopsies were analysed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used for p16(INK4A) and HPVL1 capsid analysis and PCR and ISH for HPV detection. RESULTS: High-risk HPV DNA was detected by PCR in 49% of the tumours. P16(INK4a) staining was correlated to HPV In the high-grade p16(INK4a) staining group, 94% had a complete RT response. High p16(INK4a) staining as well as the HPV PCR-positive cases had a favourable prognosis. HPV DNA ISH and L1 IHC could not predict RT response or clinical outcome. CONCLUSION: P16(INK4a) overexpression was correlated to HPV in tonsillar carcinoma and is useful for predicting RT response and prognosis in tonsillar carcinoma patients.

For rectal cancer, neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by radical proctectomy is gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. By data mining a public dataset of rectal cancer transcriptome (GSE35452) from Gene Expression Omnibus, National Center of Biotechnology Information (GEO, NCBI), we identified that VNN1 was the most significantly upregulated gene among those related to nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO:0006807). Therefore, we analyzed the clinicopathological correlation and prognostic impact of VNN1 protein (pantetheinase), which encoded by VNN1 gene. METHODS: VNN1 immunostaining was performed in 172 rectal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative CCRT followed by surgery, which were bisected into high- and low-expression subgroups. Furthermore, statistical analyses were performed to correlate the relationship between VNN1 immunoreactivity and clinicopathological features, as well as three survival indices: disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). RESULTS: High VNN1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with advanced pre-treatment and post-treatment disease and poor response to CCRT (all P ≤ .026). In addition, VNN1 overexpression was linked to adverse DSS, LRFS and MeFS in univariate analysis and served as an independent prognosticator indicating worse DSS and LRFS in multivariate analysis (all P ≤ .019). CONCLUSION: VNN1 may play a crucial role in rectal cancer progression and responsiveness to CCRT, and serve as a novel prognostic biomarker. Additional studies to clarify the molecular pathway are essential for developing potential VNN1-targeted therapies for rectal cancer.

347	p53, p16 and cyclin D1: molecular determinants of radiotherapy treatment response in oral carcinoma	English	2004	14999779	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14999779	Journal Article	\N	125	74	51	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Median	Among 125 patients who received external beam radiotherapy alone (not as a part of the adjuvant and combined regimes) with curative intent, 90 (72%) received altered fractionation (AF) and 35 (28%) received conventional fractionation (CF) radiotherapy. AF regimen adopted a total dose of 5,250 cGy over 15-16 fractions. CF regimen consisted of a total dose of 6,000 cGy over 25-26 fractions. Dose/fraction was 3.5 Gy/F and 2.4 Gy/F for AF and CF, respectively. Overall treatment time did not exceed 4 weeks for AF and 5 weeks for CF with an average of 5-6 fractions/week.	Radiotherapy	5	Management of oral cancer by radiotherapy has witnessed promising advances in the past few years, with patient-tailored radio fractionation regimens. Different fractionation schedules, conventional and altered regimes, have been used in curative radiotherapy. Although contribution of biological markers on radio response has been evaluated, its unique influence on various radio fractionation schemes has not been accounted so far. Our study analyses a set of proteins that previously demonstrated radio response influence for their possible prognostic value in decision-making process between the respective fractionation schemes. Expression patterns of regulatory proteins such as p53, cyclin D1, p16, Cdk4, p21, Rb, bcl-2 and PCNA were determined by immunohistochemistry utilizing monoclonal antibodies in 125 patients who received curative radiotherapy dose. Among these 125 patients, 90 (72%) received altered fractionation, whereas 35 (28%) received conventional fractionation. p53 over-expression correlated with local treatment failure among the patients treated with conventional fractionation whereas cyclin D1 over-expression and p16 underexpression were associated with local treatment failure as well as overall survival in altered fractionation treated cases. Our findings suggest that wild-type p53 status may be an important parameter for achieving high local control in those patients undergoing conventional fractionation, where as intact p16 and cyclin D1 status may be beneficial for effective local control in patients who are treated with altered fractionation. Furthermore, it can be assumed that conventional fractionation employs p53-mediated apoptosis, whereas altered fractionation activates the functional G1 cell-cycle checkpoint for tumor growth suppression.

348	HPV-16 infection predicts treatment outcome in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2009	19201294	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19201294	Journal Article	\N	44	35	9	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	With strong and diffuse staining ( 80 percent of tumor cells) regarded as a positive result, and negative if absent or focal.	All patients were treated with chemotherapy given concurrently with radiation therapy (IMRT). Radiotherapy was delivered, generally as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), ﬁve times weekly in daily fractions of 2 to 2.1 Gy for a total of 33 to 40 fractions using standard treatment protocols. Patients were evaluated closely at four- to six-week intervals during the ﬁrst two years of follow-up.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) treated with chemoradiation have improved outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective search was used to identify patients with OPSCC treated with concurrent chemoradiation. Pretreatment biopsy specimens were tested for HPV-16 infection and p16 expression. METHODS: Forty-four patients with OPSCC treated with concurrent chemotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy were identified. Eligibility criteria included a minimum two years of follow-up, or biopsy-proven recurrence. In situ hybridization was applied to archival tumor specimens, with HPV-16-positive status defined as positive staining of tumor cell nuclei. p16 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Twenty-seven tumors (61%) were positive for HPV-16 and 29 tumors (66%) expressed p16. HPV-16 infection was highly correlated with p16 expression (P < 10(-7)). Three-year disease-free and overall survival for all patients was 66 percent and 79 percent respectively. Patients with tumors infected with HPV-16 had improved overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after chemoradiation (OS: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.21, P = 0.01; DFS: HR = 0.30, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Patients with OPSCC tumors that are infected with HPV-16 have improved survival after treatment with concurrent chemoradiation.

349	Expression of p53, glutathione S-transferase-pi, and Bcl-2 proteins and benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer	English	1997	9150188	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9150188	Journal Article	\N	496	\N	496	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	For TP53 and BCL2, the values of 5% and 30% positive cells, were used as cutoff values to define TP53-negative or TP53-positive tumors and BCL2-negative or BCL2- positive tumors, respectively, in clinical analysis. For GSTP1, the best prognostic discrimination in the present series was achieved by considering tumors with negative cells (GSTP1-negative) or tumors with at least one positive cell in the scored cells (GSTP1-positive).	Surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy was the treatment for 496 case patients.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: In clinical breast cancer research, the utility of certain biomarkers as predictors of response to surgery, chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy has been studied intensively. Much less research has been done on the relevance of biologic predictors of response to radiotherapy, which represents an effective local-regional treatment for breast cancer. PURPOSE: The utility of biomarkers involved in DNA damage repair (p53 protein), control of programmed cell death (p53 and Bcl-2 proteins), and cellular detoxification (glutathione S-transferase-pi [GST-pi] enzyme) in predicting local breast cancer recurrence was analyzed retrospectively in two cohorts of breast cancer patients. These patients had had no detectable metastases in the axillary lymph nodes (i.e., node-negative) or in distant sites and had had similar distributions of clinicopathologic and biologic prognostic features. They had been treated by conservative surgery alone (139 case patients) or by conservative surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy (496 case patients) during the period from 1984 through 1990. METHODS: The expression of the p53, GST-pi, and Bcl-2 proteins in the specimens of primary breast tumor obtained from these patients was determined by use of immunohistochemistry; cell proliferation activity and levels of steroid receptors were determined by use of a [3H]thymidine-labeling index assay and the dextran-coated charcoal technique, respectively. The median time of follow-up of patients was 6 years. In the analyses of patient outcomes, only local failures that presented as first events were considered. RESULTS: After surgery alone, the risk of local recurrence at 6 years was higher for patients with tumors exhibiting elevated levels of p53 and GST-pi protein expression than for patients with low levels (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.7, two-sided P = .012; HR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1-6.4, two-sided P = .026, respectively). Weak or no observable expression of Bcl-2 protein was only suggestive of a higher frequency of local failures. Adjustment for patient age, tumor size, cell proliferation, and estrogen receptor status did not change these findings. Conversely, in the series of patients given conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy, there was no difference in local tumor recurrence between patients with tumors expressing or not expressing each of the three markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides indirect evidence of a benefit from radiation therapy in preventing local breast cancer relapse, particularly among node-negative patients with tumors that express elevated levels of the p53 or GST-pi proteins or that express little or no Bcl-2 protein.

For BCL2, cells with immunostaining in the cytoplasm were taken to be positive.	The patients included in this study received a consistent radiotherapy regimen (66-70 Gy to the primary site), and “drop out” cases were excluded.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and bcl-2 proteins was evaluated and the prognostic significance determined in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients treated by radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tissue sections from 55 patients with NPC were assessed for iNOS and bcl-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy, and in situ hybridization before treatment. The markers were correlated with apoptosis (detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay) and clinicopathologic parameters. RESULTS: All NPC sections exhibited positive iNOS and bcl-2 immunoreactivity, with a mean percentage of 6.24% +/- 0.58% and 17.09% +/- 2.48%, respectively. A significant positive correlation was observed between iNOS expression and the apoptotic index (p < 0.0001, Pearson's r = 0.8518), and bcl-2 expression correlated inversely with apoptosis (p = 0.0001; Pearson's r = -0.6170). A significant inverse correlation was found between iNOS and bcl-2 immunoreactivity (p < 0.0001, Pearson's r = -0.7144). Bcl-2 but not iNOS expression was associated with the stage of the tumor according to the criteria of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (1997) (p < 0.0001). Patients who had recurrence of the tumor and metastasis after radiotherapy had a lower expression of iNOS (p = 0.014 and p = 0.035, respectively), although overall survival was not significantly different statistically. Higher bcl-2 expression was also associated with local tumor recurrence (p = 0.005) but not with metastasis or overall survival. CONCLUSION: It appears that iNOS and bcl-2 expression may be potentially useful biomarkers for predicting the outcome of radiotherapy in NPC patients.

351	Molecular markers of outcome after radiotherapy in patients with prostate carcinoma: Ki-67, bcl-2, bax, and bcl-x	English	2003	12655519	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12655519	Journal Article	\N	106	106	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	If an area of the tumor had >20% of tumor cells stained for BCL2, then the tumor was considered positive. Likewise, BAX and BCL2L1 staining were considered abnormally expressed if ≥20% the tumor cells in an area of the tumor had greater or lower intensity of cytoplasmic staining compared with background non-neoplastic prostate epithelium in the same tissue sample. Loss of BAX or BCL2L1 staining relative to non-neoplastic prostate epithelium was classiﬁed as underexpression, even if areas of overexpression also were appreciated.	All patients were treated primarily with external beam radiotherapy: 102 patients were treated with conventional technique, and the other 4 patients received doses >70 Gray (Gy) using a 4-ﬁeld conventional arrangement to 46 Gy, followed by a 6-ﬁeld conformal boost to 76-78 Gy, as described previously. Dose was prescribed to the isocenter. The median dose was 66 Gy (range, 60-78 Gy). 	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Abnormal expression of key proteins of the apoptotic pathway has been associated with poor prognosis, although there have been few studies of these correlations in patients with prostate carcinoma who are treated with radiotherapy. The current study examined the association between expression levels of Ki-67, bcl-2, bax, and bcl-x in pretreatment biopsy specimens and patient outcome after definitive radiotherapy alone. METHODS: Archival pretreatment prostate biopsy tumor tissue was retrieved from 106 patients with Stage T1-T3 prostate carcinoma who were treated at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with external beam radiotherapy between 1987 and 1993. Expression levels of Ki-67 (MIB-1 staining; n = 106 patients), bcl-2 (n = 77 patients), bax (n = 70 patients), and bcl-x (both long and short splice variants; n = 72 patients) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The Ki-67 labeling index (Ki67-LI) was available for all patients and was derived from the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells. Biochemical failure after radiotherapy was defined as three consecutive rises in prostate specific antigen level on follow-up. The median follow-up was 62 months. RESULTS: High Ki67-LI (> 3.5%) expression was observed in 33% of patients, overexpression of bcl-2 was observed in 16% of patients, altered bax expression was observed in 23% of patients, and altered bcl-x expression was observed in 53% of patients. There was no correlation found between the biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of freedom from biochemical failure (bNED) and the log-rank test revealed significantly lower rates in association with high Ki67-LI, positive bcl-2, and altered bax staining. No correlation was observed between bcl-x staining and bNED. Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis confirmed that bcl-2 and bax were independent of pretreatment PSA level, Gleason score, disease stage, and Ki67-LI in predicting bNED. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities in the expression levels of bcl-2 and bax were associated with increased failure after patients were treated for prostate carcinoma with external beam radiotherapy. These biomarkers appeared to be useful in categorizing patient risk further, beyond Ki-67 staining and conventional clinical prognostic factors.	Cancer	T1-2: 74 patients, T3-4: 32 patients.
352	Correlation of clinicopathological parameters and biological markers related to apoptosis and proliferative activity with a clinical outcome in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2001	11683351	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11683351	Journal Article	\N	59	55	4	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	TP53 expression was categorized as positive when more than 10% of the tumor nuclei were stained. For BCL2 and BAX, negative, when less than 30% of tumor cells were stained, or positive, when more than 30% of tumor cells were stained.	Radiotherapy was administered at a daily dose of 2.5 Gy, four times a week. Carboplatin (100 mg/㎡) was administered intravenously in 250 ml of 5% glucose, once a week, 1 h before radiotherapy. After completion of chemoradiotherapy, salvage surgery was performed, if possible, for residual or recurrent locoregional lesions.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether biological markers related to apoptosis or proliferative activity are associated with the clinical outcome in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Immunostaining with antibodies specific to p53, bcl-2, bax, and MIB-1 was performed to evaluate expression of these proteins in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of 59 patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (carboplatin, 100 mg/m2, four to six times every week; total radiation dose of 40-65 Gy over 4-6.5 weeks). RESULTS: Multivariate analysis indicated that nodal status was a significant indicator of overall survival (OS: P = 0.001). Patients with bcl-2 positive tumors had better OS than those with bcl-2 negative tumors in both univariate (P = 0.002) and multivariate analyses (P < 0.001 ). In the univariate analysis, a considerable difference in OS was observed among the expressions of bax (P = 0.077), MIB-1 proteins (P = 0.071). and OS. but the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that nodal status is the major prognostic tactor in patients with SCC of the larynx treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. These results provide useful information for predicting prognosis. Further analysis of biological factors is needed to evaluate the value as predictive markers.

353	Overexpression of thymidylate synthetase confers an independent prognostic indicator in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2013	23726796	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23726796	Journal Article	\N	124	95	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Tumor with H-score > median of all cases were regarded as high expression.	All 124 patients with follow-up for outcome have received complete course of radiotherapy (total dose ≥ 7000 cGy) and also cisplatin-based chemotherapy in those of stage II-IV diseases, based on the previously published protocol.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Data mining on public domain identified that thymidylate synthetase (TYMS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) transcripts were significantly higher expressed in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In the folate pathway, TYMS catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridylate to deoxythymidylate using 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate [5,10-CH2=THF, derived from tetrahydrofolate (THF)], as a cofactor. This function maintains the thymidine-5-prime monophosphate pool critical for DNA replication and repair and, THF is generated from dihydrofolate (DHF) through the activity of DHFR. Immunoexpression of TYMS and DHFR were retrospectively assessed in biopsies of 124 consecutive NPC patients without initial distant metastasis and treated with consistent guidelines. The outcome was correlated with clinicopathological features and patient survivals. Results indicated that high TYMS (50%) expressions were correlated with primary tumor (p=0.008) and AJCC stage (p=0.006), and high DHFR (50%) expression were correlated with nodal status (p=0.039) and AJCC stage (p=0.029) (7th American Joint Committee on Cancer), respectively. In multivariate analyses, high TYMS expression emerged as an independent prognosticator for worse disease-specific survival (p<0.001), distal metastasis-free survival (p=0.002) and local recurrence-free survival (p<0.001), along with AJCC stage. Therefore, TYMS expression is common and associated with adverse prognosticators and might confer tumor aggressiveness through dysregulation of the nucleotide biosynthetic process.

354	The influence of epidermal growth factor receptor and tumor differentiation on the response to accelerated radiotherapy of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck in the randomized DAHANCA 6 and 7 study	English	2005	15816106	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15816106	Journal Article	\N	803	750	153	61	\N	[20.0,87.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were randomized to primary radiotherapy with a conventional schedule of 5 fx/wk or moderate accelerated radiotherapy of 6 fx/wk. Patients were treated to a total dose of 66-68 Gy given in fractions of 2 Gy/fx. However, well-differentiated T1 glottic tumors were only treated to a total dose of 62 Gy. In addition all non-glottic tumors received the hypoxic radiosensitizer nimorazole (1.2 g/㎡) in combination with the ﬁrst 30 radiation treatments.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reduction of the overall treatment time of radiotherapy has increased locoregional control and disease specific survival in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC), but the response is heterogeneous. EGFr is often overexpressed in HNSCC and has been related to the repopulation taking place during radiotherapy. The aim of the current study was to address the influence of EGFr and histopathological differentiation when the overall treatment time of radiotherapy was moderately reduced. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eight hundred and three patients with representative pretreatment tissue samples from the randomized DAHANCA 6 and 7 study of 5 vs. 6 fx/wk of radiotherapy. EGFr was visualized using immunohistochemistry and separated into high and low expression before correlation with clinical data. RESULTS: Tumors with high EGFr (84%) responded better to moderately accelerated radiotherapy, than carcinomas with low EGFr, using locoregional control as endpoint and a similar pattern was seen, stratifying by well/moderate vs. poor tumor differentiation. Therefore, a combined parameter was constructed showing a more prominent separation of response: tumors with high EGFr and well/moderate differentiation did benefit from moderate acceleration of treatment regarding locoregional control, HR 0.54 (0.37-0.78), whereas such an effect was not seen in tumors with low EGFr and/or poor differentiation, HR 0.8 (0.51-1.25). These results reflected the disease specific survival as well and were confirmed in multivariable analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Moderately accelerated fractionation is superior to conventional treatment in HNSCC but the response is heterogeneous and may be predicted by high expression of EGFr and well/moderate tumor differentiation.

355	Relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor status, p16(INK4A), and outcome in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2011	21467228	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21467228	Journal Article	\N	212	177	35	56	\N	[23.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The pattern of CDKN2A expression was semiquantitatively scored for both intensity and proportion of staining in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. Intensity was scored as 0 (none), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong); proportion was scored as 0 (1%-10% of cells stained), 1 (11%-50%), 2 (51%-80%), or 3 (81%-100%). Sections scored as 0 or 1 for intensity were defined as negative, whereas those scored 2 or 3 were defined as positive. The pattern of EGFR expression was semiquantitatively scored for both intensity and proportion of staining in the cell membrane by 2 independent observers. Intensity was scored as 0 (none), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), 3 (strong), or 4 (very strong); proportion was scored as 0 (1%-10% of cells stained), 1 (11%-50%,), 2 (51%-80%), or 3 (81%-100%). Scores for intensity and proportion were multiplied to give a final score from 0 to 12; tumors scored as 0 to 3 were defined as negative, and those scored 4 to 12 were defined as positive.	The treatment regimens involved definitive radiotherapy concurrently with cisplatin plus tirapazamine (phase I), cisplatin plus tirapazamine or cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (phase II), or cisplatin plus tirapazamine or high-dose cisplatin alone (phase III).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is a powerful prognostic biomarker in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number and protein expression have been reported to be negative predictors of outcome. This study examined the relationship between HPV status, EGFR gene copy number, EGFR protein expression, and clinical outcome in HNSCC patients treated with chemoradiation. METHODS: HPV status was determined using p16(INK4A) immunohistochemistry (IHC), EGFR gene copy number was evaluated with FISH, and EGFR protein expression by IHC in 212 subjects. RESULTS: EGFR FISH was positive in 41 of 204 (20%) patients and was negatively correlated with failure-free survival (FFS; HR = 1.84, P = 0.027) and overall survival (OS; HR = 1.78, P = 0.082). For p16(INK4A), 85 of 200 (42.5%) patients were found to be p16 positive, including 75 of 131 (57%) with oropharyngeal cancer. Patients with p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer had significantly improved FFS (HR = 0.28, P < 0.001) and OS (HR = 0.31, P = 0.002). Only 2 of 126 (1.6%) oropharyngeal cancer patients were found to be p16+/EGFR FISH+. EGFR IHC was positive in 81 of 93 (87%) of patients and was associated with poorer FFS (HR = 1.98, P = 0.35) and OS (HR = 2.52, P = 0.22). CONCLUSIONS: Increased EGFR gene copy number is largely restricted to p16(INK4A)-negative oropharyngeal cancer. Although p16(INK4A) and EGFR FISH are both predictive of outcome in univariate analyses, only p16(INK4A) remains independently predictive. IMPACT: Knowledge of HPV and EGFR status can have implications for treatment options and prognosis in HNSCC.

356	Nuclear factor-kappaB expression as a novel marker of radioresistance in early-stage laryngeal cancer	English	2010	19885926	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19885926	Journal Article	\N	105	97	8	\N	\N	[46.0,85.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The staining extents were also graded as focal (≤10%), regional (11% to 50%), or diffuse (>50%). Brieﬂy, a specimen that demonstrated >10% of tumor cells with moderate to intense staining was considered positive.	All patients were treated with external-beam radiotherapy using high-energy photons from a 4-MV X-ray linear accelerator. Patients were immobilized with a thermoplastic mask, and CT images were acquired in the treatment position to allow for 3-dimensional treatment planning. Typically, a parallel-opposed ﬁeld was used, and no elective irradiation for neck lymph nodes was performed. The median total doses of the radioresistant and radiosensitive groups were 70 Gray (Gy) (range, 56-76.8) and 66 Gy (range, 60-74.4), respectively. In the radioresistant group, 30 patients (86%) were treated once daily (2 Gy per fraction), with the total dose ranging from 56 to 70 Gy, and 5 patients (14%) were treated twice daily (1.2 Gy per fraction at 6-hour intervals), with the total dose ranging from 72 to 76.8 Gy. In the radiosensitive group, 60 patients (86%) were treated once daily, with the total dose ranging from 60 to 70 Gy, and 10 patients (14%) were treated twice daily, with the total dose ranging from 72 to 74.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the significance of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression as a marker of radioresistance in early-stage laryngeal cancer. METHODS: Thirty-five patients with local recurrence and 70 case-matched patients without local recurrence were entered in this study. NF-kappaB expression was compared with Bcl-2 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor expression by immunohistochemistry, using pretreatment biopsy specimens. The prognostic value of NF-kappaB was also evaluated. Twenty-nine recurrent tumors were compared with pretreatment tumors. RESULTS: NF-kappaB expression in pretreatment tumors significantly correlated with local tumor control (p = .01), but bcl-2 and EGF receptor expression did not. Only NF-kappaB expression showed prognostic significance for local tumor control in both univariate and multivariate analyses (p = .008 and .04, respectively). NF-kappaB expression was markedly enhanced in 23 of 29 (80%) recurrent tumors. CONCLUSION: NF-kappaB expression may be a novel marker of radioresistance in early-stage laryngeal cancer.

Each slide was rated on a four-point scale: 0, no stain; 11, light; 21, moderate; 31, heavy; and 41, intense staining. The percent distribution of staining within the invasive ductal carcinoma component was also scored. A value of 21 intensity was considered positive and an H-score (deﬁned as the product of intensity and distribution) was determined. H-score raw data were displayed as histograms and dichotomized into positive (high) versus negative (low) groups using optimized cutoffs for CCND1 (H-score ≥ 50), PCNA (H-score ≥ 50), estrogen receptor (ER) (H- score ≥75), and progesterone receptor (PR) positivity (H-score ≥ 75).	All patients were treated by lumpectomy, with or without axillary dissection, followed by radiation therapy to the intact breast to a median dose of 48 Gy, with a conedown to a total median dose of 64 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic significance of cyclin D1 (cycD1) levels in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) following lumpectomy and radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 98 patients (49 patients with IBTR and 49 matched cases without IBTR) selected from our conservatively treated breast cancer population served as the patient population for the current study. All patients were treated with lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy to the intact breast to a total median dose of 64 Gy. The patients were followed in our clinic with a median follow-up of 13 years. Immunohistochemical analysis of cycD1 in these 98 early-stage breast cancer patients was performed using a polyclonal antibody generated against the human cycD1 protein. All clinical, pathologic, and molecular variables were entered into a computerized data base for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Low levels of immunohistochemically detected cycD1 protein correlated with IBTR (p = 0.001), but there was no association between cycD1 protein levels and metastatic disease, axillary lymph node involvement, distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS). Subgroup analysis revealed that for early breast tumor relapses (within 4 years of initial breast tumor diagnosis), low levels of cycD1 were associated with IBTR (p = 0.004), but cycD1 expression was not prognostic for IBTR from breast cancer patients with late relapses (p = NS). CONCLUSION: These studies provide in vivo evidence for the prognostic and biologic significance of cycD1 expression in determining response to radiation therapy in breast cancer patients.

Patients in RTOG 0129 were assigned to cisplatin concurrent with either standard fractionation (cisplatin 100 mg/㎡ days 1, 22, and 43) or accelerated fractionation with concomitant boost (cisplatin 100 mg/㎡ on days 1 and 22).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Tobacco smoking is associated with oropharynx cancer survival, but to what extent cancer progression or death increases with increasing tobacco exposure is unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with oropharynx cancer enrolled onto a phase III trial of radiotherapy from 1991 to 1997 (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG] 9003) or of chemoradiotherapy from 2002 to 2005 (RTOG 0129) were evaluated for tumor human papillomavirus status by a surrogate, p16 immunohistochemistry, and for tobacco exposure by a standardized questionnaire. Associations between tobacco exposure and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Prevalence of p16-positive cancer was 39.5% among patients in RTOG 9003 and 68.0% in RTOG 0129. Median pack-years of tobacco smoking were lower among p16-positive than p16-negative patients in both trials (RTOG 9003: 29 v 45.9 pack-years; P = .02; RTOG 0129: 10 v 40 pack-years; P < .001). After adjustment for p16 and other factors, risk of progression (PFS) or death (OS) increased by 1% per pack-year (for both, hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.01; P = .002) or 2% per year of smoking (for both, HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.03; P < .001) in both trials. In RTOG 9003, risk of death doubled (HR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.46 to 3.28) among those who smoked during radiotherapy after accounting for pack-years and other factors, and risk of second primary tumors increased by 1.5% per pack-year (HR, 1.015; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.026). CONCLUSION: Risk of oropharyngeal cancer progression and death increases directly as a function of tobacco exposure at diagnosis and during therapy and is independent of tumor p16 status and treatment.

359	The role of epidermal growth factor receptor and E-cadherin for the outcome of reduction in the overall treatment time of radiotherapy of supraglottic larynx squamous cell carcinoma	English	2005	15848906	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15848906	Journal Article	\N	209	155	54	\N	\N	[35.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The estimated fraction was divided into high or low expression, i.e. more or less than 50% positive stained tumour cells, and only membrane staining was considered.	All patients were treated with primary radiotherapy after enrolment in the randomized DAHANCA trials 2, 5, or 6 & 7 receiving 66-68 Gy in fractions of 2 Gy but with different OTT (overall treatment time) depending on the schedule of the trial: 35 patients received treatment in a split-course setting over 9.5 weeks, 109 patients were treated with conventional radiotherapy over 6.5 weeks, whereas the OTT was 5.5 weeks for 65 patients treated with an accelerated schedule. All patients were concomitantly treated with a hypoxic radiosensitizer-either misonidazole or nimorazole according to the DAHANCA guidelines.	Radiotherapy	5	Reduction of the overall treatment time (OTT) of radiotherapy results in increased T-site control in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC). However, the response is heterogeneous and accelerated repopulation of clonogenic tumour cells during therapy may be one of the factors determining this response. The aim of the present study was to identify the influence of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and E-cadherin for T-site control when the OTT was reduced and whether the markers add information to the histopathological grading in selecting patients for accelerated radiotherapy. A total of 209 patients from randomized DAHANCA-trials with supraglottic larynx squamous cell carcinomas treated with primary radiotherapy with different OTT of 9(1/2), 6(1/2), and 5(1/2) weeks. Available formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumour tissues were re-evaluated for histopathological characteristics and stained for EGFr and E-cadherin. Data were correlated with patient and tumour characteristics and 5-year T-site control. EGFr and E-cadherin were not associated with patient or tumour characteristics except that EGFr correlated to carcinomas with a well to moderate histopathological feature. Tumours with high EGFr or low E-cadherin did benefit from reduced OTT, and the combination of the two (high EGFr and low E-cadherin) had the most significant acceleration of treatment effect, compared with tumours with other combinations of EGFr and E-cadherin expression. Tumours with high expression of EGFr and low expression of E-cadherin showed the most significant increase in T-site control when the overall treatment time of radiotherapy was reduced, and the markers may be useful for selecting patients who will benefit from accelerated radiotherapy.

A four-ﬁeld box technique was used with a frontal ﬁeld size of approximately 12 x 12 cm and a lateral ﬁeld size of 12 x 9 cm. Treatment was given with a daily dose of 2.0 Gy to a mean dose of 67 Gy (range 61.3-71.6 Gy). Thirty-five of the patients had not received any androgen deprivation therapy prior to radiation. Five patients had been treated with oestrogen, one patient had been surgically castrated and one patient had received estramustine phosphate treatment. Three patients had received radiation and castration as initial therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent experimental evidence suggests that overexpression of bcl-2, a protein functioning by blocking apoptosis, may influence the treatment outcome in human tumours, including prostate cancer. To test the clinical implications of this hypothesis, tumours from patients with prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy were investigated for bcl-2 immunoreactivity (IR) and correlated with prognosis and treatment outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bcl-2 IR was evaluated in archival tumour specimens obtained through transurethral resection from 42 patients with localized prostate cancer (T0-T4, N0 and M0). Bcl-2 IR expression was related to stage, grade and cancer-specific survival. Specimens were obtained prior to administrating routine radiotherapy for all patients. RESULTS: Bcl-2 IR was present in 19/42 (45%) tumours. The bcl-2-positive patients had a significantly longer cancer-specific survival than the bcl-2-negative patients (10.3 versus 3.4 years, P<0.04). At follow-up (7-19 years), nine patients were still alive, 26 patients had died of prostate cancer and seven patients had died of other causes. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that pre-treatment bcl-2 overexpression is related to a favourable outcome in prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. Low bcl-2 along with a high stage may be a predictor of poor prognosis and these patients might benefit from additional treatment.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	\N

We also assessed the percentage of immunoreactive begin and maligant epithelium. Reactivity score was determined using the formula, intensity score x percentage of tissue involved. For subsequent statistical analysis tumors with a positive net score were assigned an overall value of 2 and those tumors with a net score of 0, indicationg no increase in immunoreactivity over bengin epithelium, were assigned overall value of 1. Tumors with negative net score, indicating high nonspecific staining, were assigned a value of 0 and were exempt from further analysis.	All patients received external beam conformal radiation therapy. Of the 54 patients 14 received pretreatment hormonal ablation therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: Clinicians have long been hampered by the inability to distinguish patients with localized prostate cancer who will and will not respond to radiotherapy. In a significant proportion of patients therapy fails as determined by increasing posttreatment serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). We evaluated the expression of 2 key regulators of apoptosis, bcl-2 and p53, relative to treatment outcomes in patients who received external beam radiotherapy for clinically organ confined carcinoma of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for bcl-2 and p53 on pretreatment needle biopsies was performed in 54 patients who were treated with radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Expression was scored using strict criteria. Nadir PSA less than 1 ng./ml. after therapy was considered a successful treatment response. RESULTS: There was a predominance of stage T1c cancer (74%) with a mean Gleason score of 6.9 and an average pretreatment PSA of 25.3 ng./ml. Overall 54% of the patients did not have a nadir PSA of less than 1 ng./ml. Of the bcl-2 positive cases therapy ultimately failed in 85%. Similarly 88% of the patients with p53 positive biopsies had treatment failure and in all with bcl-2 as well as p53 expression radiotherapy failed. Expression of bcl-2 and p53 was an independent prognostic variable for treatment failure with odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 7.3 and 10.8, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of bcl-2 and p53 was associated with treatment failure after external beam radiation therapy. These findings suggest that bcl-2 and p53 expression in pretreatment biopsies may be helpful for predicting response to definitive radiotherapy.	The Journal of Urology	\N

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To determine the significance of Ki-67/MIB1 staining as a marker of patient outcome for prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment archival prostate biopsy tumor tissue was available from 106 stage T1-T4 prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy between 1987 and 1993 at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Diagnosis was made from prostate needle biopsy in 64 cases and from transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in 42 cases. All patients had a pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and no patient had evidence of metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining for MIB1 was used to determine the percentage of Ki-67-positive tumor cells, the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki67-LI). Biochemical failure after radiotherapy was defined as three rises in PSA on follow-up. Median follow-up was 62 months. RESULTS: The mean and median Ki67-LI for the entire cohort was 3.2 and 2.3. The mean and median Ki67-LIs for those diagnosed by needle biopsy were 3.2 and 2.3, and by TURP were 3.1 and 2.4. For all patients, mean Ki67-LI levels were significantly higher with stage T3/T4 disease, Gleason 7-10 disease, and in those that developed treatment failure. Similar relationships were observed when the Ki67-LI was dichotomized into low (< or =3.5%) and high (>3.5%) groups. Actuarial freedom from biochemical failure (bNED) when Ki67-LI was low and high was 76 and 33% at 5 years (P < 0.0001, log rank). Similar statistically significant differences were observed when the TURP and needle biopsy groups were analyzed separately. Cox proportional hazards regression showed that dichotomized Ki67-LI was an independent correlate of bNED, along with pretreatment PSA, Gleason score, and clinical stage. CONCLUSIONS: The Ki67-LI obtained from pretreatment prostate cancer tissue is a strong independent predictor of failure after radiotherapy using biochemical criteria. This prognostic factor was equally valuable for patients diagnosed by TURP or needle biopsy.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

Radiotherapy was delivered via a four-field box with 18 MV photons, using a shrinking field technique in all but one patient, who received a conformal six-field boost after 46 Gy to a total dose of 78 Gy. The dose was specified to the isocenter at 2 Gy per day.	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to evaluate the relationship of Ki-67 labeling index (Ki67-LI) to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy, S phase fraction (SPF), other clinical prognostic factors, and clinical outcome for patients with prostate cancer treated by external beam radiotherapy. METHODS: Tissue was retrieved from 42 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate before treatment with external beam radiotherapy between 1987-1993. DNA histogram profiles were classified as diploid (diploid + near-diploid) and nondiploid (tetraploid + aneuploid). Immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67 by the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody was used to calculate Ki67-LI. Median patient follow-up was 62 months. Treatment failure was defined as two consecutive rises in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or clinical evidence of disease recurrence. RESULTS: The mean and median Ki67-LIs were 3.1 and 2.4, respectively (range, 0-12.4). Mean Ki67-LI values were significantly associated with higher stage, Gleason score, and pretreatment PSA. Nondiploid tumors had significantly higher Ki67-LIs, as did patients who failed radiotherapy over the follow-up period. SPF was not significantly correlated with Ki67-LI. As a categorical variable, the most significant relationships were seen when Ki67-LI was subdivided into thirds around the median (Ki67-LI </=1.5%, Ki67-LI >1.5-3.5%, and Ki67-LI >3.5%). This trichotomous variable correlated significantly with pretreatment PSA (P = 0.0008), tumor stage (P = 0.016), Gleason score (P = 0.024), and treatment failure (P = 0.0015), but not with DNA-ploidy (P = 0.15). In actuarial univariate analyses, Ki67-LI appeared to be a more significant predictor of patient outcome (P = 0.003) than DNA-ploidy (P = 0.035). CONCLUSIONS: The Ki67-LI correlated with known prognostic factors such as pretreatment PSA, tumor stage, and Gleason score, and was also weakly related to DNA-ploidy. In comparison to DNA-ploidy, Ki67 LI seems to be a better correlate of treatment outcome.	The Prostate	T1-2: 35 patients, T3-4: 7 patients.
365	Impact of E2F-1 expression on clinical outcome of gastric adenocarcinoma patients with adjuvant chemoradiation therapy	English	2008	18172256	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18172256	Journal Article	\N	465	310	155	54	\N	[23.0,70.0)	Immunohistochemistry	We considered the E2F1 and TYMS as positive when >5% and >25% of cancer cell nuclei showed positive immunostaining, respectively.	All patients received adjuvant chemoradiation therapy after curative surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: There are no reliable prognostic markers that identify gastric cancer patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemoradiation therapy. E2F-1 was shown to be associated with radiosensitivity and chemosensitivity in certain tumor types. Therefore, we analyzed expression and prognostic significance of E2F-1 along with thymidylate synthase (TS) in R(0)-resected gastric adenocarcinoma patients, who underwent adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The chemosensitivity to 5-FU and radiosensitivity were tested in three E2F-1-overexpressed gastric cancer cell lines in vitro. The expressions of TS and E2F-1 were analyzed in 467 R(0)-resected primary gastric cancer patients, who received adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with 5-FU and leucovorin using tissue microarray. RESULTS: The E2F-1 immunopositivity rate was 22.2% (103 of 465 samples) with a cutoff value of 5% immunoreactivity, whereas the TS-positive expression occurred in 19.0% of the 463 tumors tested. Using stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression modeling, multivariate analyses showed that the E2F-1 immunopositivity predicted more favorable survival as compared with the E2F-1 immunonegativity with borderline statistical significance [P = 0.050, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.702, 95% confidence interval, 0.487, 1.013]. However, the E2F-1 immunopositivity did not retain its statistical significance at multivariate analysis for predicting disease-free survival (data not shown, P = 0.270), but stage was the only influential factor for disease-free survival in stages IB to IV (M(0)) patients (P < 0.001). TS immunopositivity did not influence survival (P = 0.459) or disease-free survival (P = 0.447). CONCLUSION: E2F-1 is a potentially novel independent prognostic factor that may identify gastric cancer patients who will likely benefit from adjuvant chemoradiation therapy following curative resection.

366	Significance of interleukin-6 signaling in the resistance of pharyngeal cancer to irradiation and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor	English	2010	20206020	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20206020	Journal Article	\N	95	\N	\N	\N	\N	[35.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The criterion for immunohistochemical scoring was that a specimen with >10% positive staining tumor cells should be considered in the positive group.	We retrospectively collected specimens from 95 consecutive patients with pharyngeal SCC at diagnosis (35 patients were treated with surgery combined with adjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy; and 60 patients were treated deﬁnitively with chemoradiotherapy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Tumor eradication by chemoradiotherapy for pharyngeal cancer has not been particularly successful. Targeting epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) could be a potential treatment strategy providing additional benefits, but only a subset of these tumors gives a clinically significant response to EGFR inhibitors. The aim has been to identify the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling and its predictive power in the treatment response of pharyngeal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Human pharyngeal cancer cell lines, including the hypopharyngeal cancer cell line FaDu and its derived cell line FaDu-C225-R, were selected. Changes in tumor growth, response to treatment, and responsible signaling pathway were investigated in vitro. Furthermore, 95 pharyngeal cancer tissue specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining, and correlations were made between levels of IL-6, IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), p-AKT, and p-STAT3 expression and the clinical outcome of patients. RESULTS: In vitro, either extrinsic IL-6 stimulation of cancer cells or intrinsically activated IL-6 signaling detected in FADu-C225-R cells results in resistance to irradiation and EGFR inhibitor. Blocking IL-6 signaling attenuated aggressive tumor behavior and sensitized the cells to treatments. The responsible mechanisms included decreased p-STAT3, less nuclear translocation of EGFR, and subsequently attenuated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Regarding clinical data, staining of p-STAT3 and IL-6 was significantly linked with lower response rates to treatments and shorter survival in pharyngeal cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 and p-STAT3 may be significant predictors of pharyngeal carcinoma, and regulating IL-6 signaling can be considered a promising therapeutic approach.

367	The importance of immunohistochemical expression of EGFr in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy	English	2006	16750322	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16750322	Journal Article	\N	165	109	56	58	\N	[25.0,89.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients underwent surgery of the primary tumor. Surgery consisted of a transoral excision in 24 cases (14%) with early-stage tumors, combined with a discontinuous neck dissection in 17 cases (10%). In 141 cases (86%) surgery consisted of more extensive procedures, i.e., commando-resection including partial or total glossectomy and neck dissection. Surgery was performed in the VU University Medical Center in all cases. Radiotherapy was delivered using megavoltage equipment (6-MV linear accelerator). The target volume of the initial ﬁeld encompassed the primary site plus a 2-cm margin and the entire surgical bed. In case of N , the neck nodes on both sides were included in the initial target volume as well. Generally, the initia target volume was irradiated using two opposing lateral ﬁelds. The initial ﬁeld was irradiated with a fraction dose of 2 Gy (5 times a week/once a day) to the central axis up to a total dose of 46 to 50 Gy. In case the total dose was 50 Gy, the spinal cord was shielded after 40 Gy and the anterior part of the neck was irradiated with a dose per fraction of 2 Gy up to 50 Gy using photons, whereas the posterior neck triangle was irradiated using electrons (6 to 12 MeV) with a dose per fraction of 3 Gy up to a total dose of 49 Gy. The dose of the electrons was speciﬁed at the 100% isodose level, and the energy of the electrons was determined in such a way that the maximum dose to the spinal cord was 20% or less. In case of negative surgical margins, the primary site with a 1-cm margin was boosted, using a dose per fraction of 2.5 Gy (5 times a week) up to a median total dose of 55 Gy. In case of positive or close surgical margins, the median total dose to the primary site with a 1-cm margin was 62.5 Gy. In case of lymph node metastases with extranodal spread, the median total dose to these regions was 62.5 Gy. In most cases, the booster ﬁeld was irradiated using a shrinking ﬁeld technique. Sixty-four patients (39%) started postoperative radiotherapy on Monday and ﬁnished their treatment on Friday with an overall treatment time (OTTRT) of less than 6 weeks. In 70 patients (42%), the OTTRT was 6-7 weeks, and in 31 patients (19%) the OTTRT was more than 7 weeks. The main reasons for differences in the OTTRT were differences in total dose and unplanned treatment interruptions due to severe mucosal reactions.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of epidermal growth factor (EGFr) expression in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) treated with curative surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective study included 165 OCSCC patients. The expression of EGFr was assessed on paraffin-embedded tissue of the primary tumor by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody directed against EGFr. Intensity of the EGFr expression was scored by two authors blinded for the clinical outcome. RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, locoregional control at 3 years (LRC) in the EGFr-negative cases was 69% compared with 77% in the EGFr-positive cases (p = 0.22). In the multivariate analysis for local control, a significant interaction was found between EGFr and overall treatment time of radiation (OTT). After stratification for EGFr expression, the OTT was of no importance in the EGFr-negative cases, whereas a significant difference in LRC was found in the EGFr-positive cases, in which the LRC after 3 years was 69% and 94% in case of an OTT of 0-42 days and >42 days, respectively (p = 0.009; hazard ratio = 3.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-8.96). No significant association was found between EGFr expression and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, no association was found between EGFr expression and outcome regarding locoregional control and overall survival. However, the results of the present study suggest that patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity with high EGFr expression benefit more from a reduction of the overall treatment time of postoperative radiation than those with low EGFr expression.

METHODS: A total of 119 patients with stage II-III cervical squamous cancer treated with concurrent chemo-radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. The expression of HIF-1α was detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between HIF-1α expression and disease prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: The number of HIF-1α positive expression was 86 cases (72.3%), and the number of HIF-1α negative expression was 33 cases (27.7%). For stage II and III patients, the effective rate in HIF-1α negative and positive expression groups after treatment was (94.7%, 85.7%) and (87.8%, 75.6%), respectively. The difference was statistically significant (P=0.032, P=0.041). The local control rate after 2 years of treatment in HIF-1α positive group was significantly higher than that in the HIF-1α negative expression group (89.4%, 78.5% vs 75.5%. 70.2%, P=0.021, P=0.035). The survival rate after 2 years of of treatment in HIF-1α negative group was significantly higher than that in the HIF-1α positive expression group (100%, 85.7% vs 91.2%, 72.9%, P=0.034, P=0.041). CONCLUSION: HIF-1α is positively expressed in most of cervical squamous cancer cells, which is correlated with poor prognosis in stage II and III patients.

XRCC2 was found to be overexpressed in rectal cancer tissues resected from patients who underwent surgery without PRT. In addition, overall survival for LARC patients was improved in XRCC2-negative patients compared with XRCC2-positive patients after treatment with PRT (P < 0.001). XRCC2 expression was also associated with an increase in LARC radioresistance. Conversely, XRCC2-deficient cancer cells were more sensitive to irradiation in vitro, and a higher proportion of these cells underwent cell death induced by G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. When XRCC2 was knocked down, the repair of DNA double-strand breaks caused by irradiation was impaired. Therefore, XRCC2 may increases LARC radioresistance by repairing DNA double-strand breaks and preventing cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, the present data suggest that XRCC2 is a useful predictive biomarker of PRT treatment response in LARC patients. Thus, inhibition of XRCC2 expression or activity represents a potential therapeutic strategy for improving PRT response in LARC patients.

371	Decreased PLK1 expression denotes therapy resistance and unfavourable disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy	English	2016	27712975	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27712975	Journal Article	\N	75	46	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Then we employed tertile values to deﬁne the best cut-off point, which was estimated in 30 (meaning 10% of cells with strong staining, 15% of cells with moderate staining or 30% of cells with weak staining). With these criteria we divided the cases in two groups (low and high expression).	Patients underwent standardized preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision. All patients received 28 sessions of radiation therapy (45 Gy on pelvic area and 50.4 Gy on the tumour bed), concomitantly with ﬂuoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) plays a key role in mitotic cell division and DNA damage repair. It has been observed that either up-regulated or down-regulated Plk1 could induce mitotic defects that results in aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, probably depending on the context. Few previous reports have associated Plk1 expression with prognosis and response to radiotherapy in rectal carcinomas. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic impact of Plk1 expression and its role in predicting response to neoadjuvant cheomoradiotherapy in rectal cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis of Plk1 expression was performed in the pre-treatment tumour specimens from 75 rectal cancer patients. We analysed the assocation between Plk1 expression and clinicopathological parameters, pathologic response and outcome. Opposed to previous reports on this issue, low expression of Plk1 was significantly associated with a high grade of differentiation (P=0.0007) and higher rate of distant metastasis (P=0.014). More importantly, decreased levels of Plk1 were associated with absence of response after neoadjuvant therapy (P=0.049). Moreover, low Plk1 expression emerged as an unfavourable prognostic factor for disease-free survival in the non-responder group of patients (P=0.037). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased Plk1 expression was associated with poor pathologic response and worse disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, suggesting Plk1 as a clinically relevant marker to predict chemoradiotherapy response and outcome.

372	Correlation between ERCC1 expression and concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer	English	2015	26125779	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26125779	Journal Article	\N	76	59	17	46	\N	[35.0,62.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The percentage of positive cells <25% was defined as negative expression (-), while expression in >25% of cells was defined as positive expression (+). Positive expression was further sub-grouped into grade one/+ (25-49% of cells), grade two/++ (50-74% of cells), and grade three/+++ (≥75% of cells).	All patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. For chemotherapy, 80 mg/㎡ of cisplatin was administered by iv infusion; radiotherapy was delivered on the first, twenty-second, and forty-third day with a 6 MV linear accelerator, conventional fractionated irradiation, 5 times per week, with an average dose of 74 Gy (range 70-78 Gy) in the nasopharyngeal area, 66 Gy in cervical lymph nodes, and 50 Gy in the supraclavicular field. Induction chemotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy was not performed for any patient.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	In this study, the expression of DNA excision repair cross-complementing gene 1 (ERCC1) in local advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma has been correlated with the efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A total of 76 patients diagnosed with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed by nasopharyngeal biopsy and undergoing single-agent cisplatin chemotherapy (80 mg/m(2)) with concurrent radiotherapy (on the first, twenty-second, and forty-third day, 5 times per week, mean dose 74 Gy, range 70-78 Gy) at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between January and December 2010 were included. After chemoradiotherapy, outcomes and long-term survival were evaluated. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect expression of ERCC1 protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The relationship between the expression of ERCC1 and efficacy of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and long-term survival were analyzed. ERCC1 was expressed in 42.1% of cases. The expression of ERCC1 was correlated with T stage and clinical staging (P < 0.05), but not with gender, age, or N stage. The response rate in the ERCC1-positive and ERCC1-negative groups was 75.0% and 97.7%, respectively (P < 0.05). In the 72 cases with follow-up available, 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were 91.0, 83.3, and 79.0%; they were 92.4, 87.8, 80.5%, respectively, in the ERCC1-positive group, and 87.9, 77.4, 77.4%, respectively, in the ERCC1-negative group. The expression of ERCC1 may be a sensitive prognostic indicator of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

373	GOLPH3 overexpression correlates with poor response to neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis in locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2016	27634904	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27634904	Journal Article	\N	148	89	59	\N	63.2000000000000028	\N	Immunohistochemistry	GOLPH3 positive cells and staining intensity as follows: 0, no positive cells; 1, 1-10% positive tumor cells; 2, 11-35% positive tumor cells; 3, 36-70% positive tumor cells; 4, > 70% positive tumor cells. Staining intensity was scored as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak positive (slight yellow); 2, medium staining (claybank); 3, strong positive (sepia). Staining index for GOLPH3 expression was calculated by the two scoring systems, yielding possible scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12. Scores higher than 6 were considered high expression; those lower than 4 represented low expression.	All the rectal cancer cases received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT), followed by surgical treatment (total mesorectal excision, TME). Specifically, whole pelvic radiotherapy was performed with DT = 50.4Gy/28 times (four fields of irradiation or 3D conformal radiotherapy). The concurrent chemotherapy included 5-Fu (5-fluorouracil) continuously pumped or capecitabine in combination with oxaliplatin. TME was performed at 4-6 weeks after nCRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) combined with surgery is a standard therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The aim of this study was to assess the expression of GOLPH3 (Golgi phosphoprotein 3), a newly found oncogene, in LARC as well as its relationship with nCRT sensitivity and prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed 148 LARC cases receiving nCRT and total mesorectal excision (TME). Immunohistochemistry was used to assess GOLPH3 and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) in tumor tissues. Then, the associations of GOLPH3 with pathological characteristics and prognosis of rectal cancer were assessed. The 148 cases included 77 with high GOLPH3 expression (52.03%), which was associated with tumor invasive depth and lymphatic metastasis. Cases with high GOLPH3 expression had 2.58 and 2.71 fold higher local relapse and distant metastasis rates compared with the low expression group. Correlation analyses showed that GOLPH3 was an independent indicator for judging tumor down-staging and postoperative TRG (tumor regression grade), indicating it could predict nCRT sensitivity. In addition, GOLPH3 expression was associated with mTOR levels. Multiple-factor analysis indicated that GOLPH3 was an independent prognosis indicator for 5 year-DFS (disease free survival) and OS (overall survival) in LARC. These results reveal that GOLPH3 is an independent predictive factor for nCRT sensitivity and prognosis in LARC, with a mechanism related to mTOR.

Staining intensity and extent were multiplied to produce a weighted score for each tumor whose values were dichotomized at the median for subsequent analyses.	Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy consisting of infusional 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) (225 mg/㎡) and external beam radiation therapy (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions). Four to six weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, all patients underwent surgical resection with negative surgical margins (R0 resections) being achieved in all.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Beclin 1 is an essential regulator of autophagy that is induced in response to cellular stress and serves to maintain cell survival in established tumors. We recently demonstrated that Beclin 1 suppression can sensitize colorectal cancer cells to radiation-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that the level of Beclin 1 expression may be associated with radiation sensitivity in vivo. We determined the association of Beclin 1 expression in pretreatment rectal cancer tissues with response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in surgical resection specimens. Stages II and III (n = 96) rectal adenocarcinoma patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection with curative intent. Beclin 1 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and the expression level was dichotomized at the median value with categorization into low and high groups. We identified 56 (58.3%) and 40 (41.7%) patients whose tumors had high- versus low-level Beclin 1 expression, respectively. Rectal cancers with high versus low Beclin 1 expression were significantly less likely to be downstaged after chemoradiation treatment (45% [25/55] vs. 58% [22/38]; p = 0.02). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, histological grade and baseline tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, the impact of Beclin 1 expression on tumor downstaging remained statistically significant (p = 0.03). The association of the level of Beclin 1 expression with the rate of tumor downstaging after chemoradiation is consistent with in vitro data, and suggests that Beclin 1 may be a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of chemoradiation in patients with rectal cancer.

375	Focal adhesion kinase: predictor of tumour response and risk factor for recurrence after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer	English	2016	27171907	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27171907	Journal Article	\N	73	46	27	74	\N	[48.0,90.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Patients underwent chemoradiotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision.

Concomitant ﬂuoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy (standard regimen of 5-FU or capecitabine) was administered. In 14 (19%) of the patients, 5-FU was combined with oxaliplatin.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Rectal cancer represents about 30% of colorectal cancers, being around 50% locally advanced at presentation. Chemoradiation (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for these locally advanced stages. However, it is not free of adverse effects and toxicity and the complete pathologic response rate is between 10% and 30%. This makes it extremely important to define factors that can predict response to this therapy. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression has been correlated with worse prognosis in several tumours and its possible involvement in cancer radio- and chemosensitivity has been suggested; however, its role in rectal cancer has not been analysed yet. To analyse the association of FAK expression with tumour response to CRT in locally advanced rectal cancer. This study includes 73 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer receiving standard neoadjuvant CRT followed by total mesorectal excision. Focal adhesion kinase protein levels were immunohistochemically analysed in the pre-treatment biopsies of these patients and correlated with tumour response to CRT and patients survival. Low FAK expression was significantly correlated with local and distant recurrence (P = 0.013). Low FAK expression was found to be a predictive marker of tumour response to neoadjuvant therapy (P = 0.007) and patients whose tumours did not express FAK showed a strong association with lower disease-free survival (P = 0.01). Focal adhesion kinase expression predicts neoadjuvant CRT response in rectal cancer patients and it is a clinically relevant risk factor for local and distant recurrence.

390	Expression of HER-2 in rectal cancers treated with preoperative radiotherapy: a potential biomarker predictive of metastasis	English	2014	24819100	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24819100	Journal Article	\N	142	86	56	58	\N	[24.0,85.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Scoring was based on a four-tier system as follows: 0 (no staining), 1+ (1%-25% positive cells), 2+ (26%-75% positive cells), or 3+ (76%-100% positive cells). a score of 0 or 1+ was considered negative, and a score of 3+ was considered positive.	Prior to the PRT (preoperative radiotherapy), biopsies were carried using a rigid proctoscope, and tissue specimens were collected. the patients then received 30 Gy in 10 daily fractions over a period of 2 weeks (SIMENS PRIMUS 2916 linear accelerator). About 14 days after completion of the PRT, abdominoperineal resection or low anterior resection was performed strictly in accordance with the principles of TME (total mesorectal excision). All patients also received adjuvant chemotherapy (standard regimen of 5-fu or capecitabine) within 6 months after surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests HER-2 overexpression may be predictive of prognosis in colorectal cancer patients, though this remains controversial. OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to assess the prognostic value of HER-2 expression in locally advanced rectal cancer patients after preoperative radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: HER-2 expression was evaluated based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of resected specimens from 142 mid-to-low rectal cancer patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to confirm HER-2 overexpression in samples with an IHC score of 2+. Tumor regression grading (TRG) of the primary tumors was determined semiquantitatively using a tumor regression grading scheme advocated in the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual 7 edition. RESULTS: When the total staining intensity was evaluated, 106 samples (74.6%) showed barely-perceptible positivity (0-1+; HER-2--negative), 15 samples (10.6%) showed moderate positivity (2+) and 21 samples (14.8%) showed strong positivity (3+, HER-2 positive). FISH confirmed that 2 cases showing moderate HER-2 positivity (2+) overexpressed HER2. There was no significant difference between the HER-2 positive and -negative groups with respect to age, gender, TRG, TNM stage, downstaging status, lymphovascular invasion or tumor differentiation. A significant correlation was found between HER-2 overexpression and the incidence of distant metastasis (p = 0.005). Subgroup analysis revealed this correlation was not significant (p = 0.247) in the radiation-insensitive (TRG0-2) subgroup, whereas a significant correlation (p = 0.026) between HER-2 overexpression and distant metastasis was found in the radiation-resistant (TRG3) subgroup. Multivariate analysis identified ypN stage (OR = 0.473, p = 0.002)and overexpression of HER-2 (OR = 3.704, p = 0.008) as independent risk factors for distant metastasis. There was no correlation between HER-2 overexpression and disease-free survival or overall survival among the study population. LIMITATIONS: We reported that HER-2 overexpression was correlated with distant metastasis in rectal cancer patients, especially in the radiation-insensitive group. However, there are certain limitations. First, this study was limited due to the fact that the number of rectal patients enrolled was only 142, which is relatively small. Second, HER-2 expression was measured by IHC with a positive ratio around 15%, which is fairly high according to the literature. Also, we collected the tissue samples preoperatively. It would be interesting to know the HER-2 expression levels pre- and postradiotherapy, as well as their correlation with local recurrence or distant metastasis. Finally, in rectal cancer patients, there is little information published on HER-2 and its role in tumor progression and metastasis. Therefore, we are pursuing the regulatory molecule underlined. CONCLUSIONS: HER-2 is overexpressed in around 15% of rectal cancer patients who receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Moreover, HER-2 overexpression could be a predictive biomarker of distant metastasis in rectal cancer patients after preoperative radiotherapy, especially patients showing a poor response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	In colorectal cancer (CRC), fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) is upregulated and acts as an oncogene. This study investigated the impact of this receptor on the response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy by analyzing its levels in rectal tumors of patients with different responses to the therapy. Cellular mechanisms of FGFR4-induced radioresistance were analyzed by silencing or over-expressing FGFR4 in CRC cell line models. Our findings showed that the FGFR4 staining score was significantly higher in pre-treatment biopsies of non-responsive than responsive patients. Similarly, high expression of FGFR4 inhibited radiation response in cell line models. Silencing or inhibition of FGFR4 resulted in a reduction of RAD51 levels and decreased survival in radioresistant HT29 cells. Increased RAD51 expression rescued cells in the siFGFR4-group. In radiosensitive SW480 and DLD1 cells, enforced expression of FGFR4 stabilized RAD51 protein levels resulting in enhanced clearance of γ-H2AX foci and increased cell survival in the mismatch repair (MMR)-proficient SW480 cells. MMR-deficient DLD1 cells are defective in homologous recombination repair and no FGFR4-induced radioresistance was observed. Based on our results, FGFR4 may serve as a predictive marker to select CRC patients with MMR-proficient tumors who may benefit from pre-operative radiotherapy.

One of two chemotherapeutic regimens was delivered concurrent with radiotherapy: (1) FOLFOX: fluorouracil 3.0 g/㎡ , CIV lasting for 48 h; calcium folinate 200.0 mg/㎡ , day 1; oxaliplatin 100.0 mg/㎡ , day 1; repeated for three weeks (n=6 patients, 7.3%); and (2) XELOX: capecitabine 1000.0 mg/㎡ bid, days 1-14; oxaliplatin 100.0 mg/㎡ , day 1; repeated for three weeks (n = 76 patients, 92.7%). Surgery was performed approximately 7 weeks (range: 4-20 weeks) after the completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The surgical procedure was either low anterior resection/ double stapling method (n=54 patients, 65.9%) or abdominoperineal resection (n = 28 patients, 34.1%).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To investigate predictive value of APAF-1 and COX-2 expression in pathologic complete response (pCR) for patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (RAC) who were treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neo-CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME).   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry assay was used to detect expression of APAF-1 and COX-2 in paraffin-wax embedded tissues obtained before neo-CRT for patients with RAC. A 5-point tumor-regression grade (TRG) based on the ratio of residual tumor to fibrosis according to Dworak's scoring system was used to assess neo-CRT response. The relationship between expression of APAF-1 and COX-2 genes and pCR was explored. RESULTS: pCR (TRG4) was observed in 23 patients (28.0%). pCR were more likely to be achieved for those with APAF-1 over-expression or lower expression of COX-2. pCR rate in patients with combination of high APAF-1 and low COX-2 expression was 56.0%, significantly higher than those with other combination of APAF1 and COX-2 expression. Multivariate analysis showed that over-expression of APAF-1 and suppressed expression of COX-2 were independent predictive factors for pCR. CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemical evaluation of APAF-1 and COX-2 expression on pretreatment specimen may be used to predict pCR to neo-CRT in patients with RAC. The potential of the markers in monitoring pCR patient merits further investigation.	Oncotarget	Stage II: 16 patients, Stage III: 66 patients.

Patients underwent surgery 6-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a favorable prognosticator in rectal cancer patients. We investigated whether the biological features of the primary tumor affect pCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six patients treated with capecitabine-oxaliplatin and pelvic conformal radiotherapy were considered. Forty-three patients underwent surgery, and the pathologic response was scored according to the tumor regression grade (TRG) scale. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor, poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase-1, X-ray cross-complimenting, thymidylate synthase (TS) and Ki67 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on rectal biopsies obtained before chemoradiotherapy, and scored as the percentage of positive cells. Cutoffs were selected based on ROC analysis. The correlation between the biological factors and the TRG coded as TRG1 (pCR) versus TRG ≥2 (no pCR) was assessed by the χ(2) test and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Low EGFR (p = 0.007), high TS (p = 0.002), and high Ki67 (p = 0.05) were strongly associated with pCR. Upon univariate analysis, TRG significantly affected disease-free survival (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: pCR was significantly associated with high TS, high Ki67 and low EGFR expression. Patients with pCR have a significantly lower incidence of relapse.

379	Prognostic significance of survivin in rectal cancer patients treated with surgery and postoperative concurrent chemo-radiation therapy	English	2016	27391438	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27391438	Journal Article	\N	116	68	48	55	\N	[30.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For TP53, no staining or staining in less than 20% of the tumor cells was defined as the loss of TP53.	Treatment procedures consisted of curative total mesorectal excision and adjuvant CCRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy). Adjuvant RT (radiotherapy) was delivered to the whole pelvis with a dose of 45 gray (Gy) in 25 fractions. The radiation field encompassed a volume that included the anastomotic site, mesorectum, and regional area, including perirectal, presacral, and internal iliac lymphatics. An additional boost to the primary tumor bed was also given in some patients with evidence of adverse pathologic features such as a close/positive surgical resection margin. Postoperative chemotherapy generally consisted of intravenous bolus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/day) with or without a combination with leucovorin (20 mg/㎡/day) for five consecutive days every four weeks through a total of six cycles. Pelvic RT was generally administered during the third chemotherapy cycle. During CCRT, two cycles of bolus 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/day) were administered for three days matched with the RT start and end date. In patients with a positive resection margin, RT was started with the first cycle of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study is designed to investigate the expression of survivin and p53 in human rectal cancer tissues and analyze associations between expression and clinical outcomes in terms of disease recurrence and survival duration. RESULTS: During follow-up (median 119.0, range 6.6 to 161.3 months), tumor recurrence was detected in 50 patients (43.1%), and local recurrence developed as a first failure site in 13 patients (11.2%). Positive immunostaining of nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin was observed in about one quarter of patients, and about half of all patients had positive staining for p53. Both survivin and p53 were significant prognostic factors of disease-free survival in the univariate analyses, but only survivin remained a significant prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with 116 locally advanced rectal cancer patients who underwent total mesorectal excision (TME) followed by postoperative concurrent chemo-radiation therapy (CCRT). Immunohistochemical staining was conducted using antibodies for survivin or p53, and their expression was analyzed using an individual score that combined the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of nuclear and cytoplasmic survivin in locally advanced rectal cancer patients was associated with a higher recurrence rate in rectal cancer patients treated with TME followed by postoperative CCRT.

380	Possible predictors of histopathological response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for rectal cancer	English	2012	22160161	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22160161	Journal Article	\N	64	35	29	59	\N	[34.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Pre-treatment workup consisted of digital rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy, biopsy, abdomino-pelvic CT, pelvic MRI, chest X-ray or CT. In all cases, 3D planned conformal radiotherapy was carried out with belly board in prone position, with 18 MV photons. Primary tumor as well as lymph nodes at risk was covered with 3 irradiation Welds and received 45 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 5 weeks. As a concomitant chemotherapy, 500 mg/㎡ of 5-Xuorouracil continuous infusion and 30 mg/㎡ folic acid bolus on days 1-5 of 1st and 5th weeks of radiotherapy were administered. Four weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients were re-staged and definitive surgical resection was performed 6-9 weeks after neoadjuvant therapy in 64 cases.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) varies greatly in patients suffering from locally advanced rectal cancer. Our aim was to correlate the response to CRT with the pre-treatment expression of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), small heat shock protein 16.2 (sHsp 16.2), phospho-Akt (p-Akt), growth hormone-releasing hormone receptor (GHRH-R) and heme-binding protein 2 (SOUL) in order to try to identify one or more as a predictive marker. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients receiving combined CRT for locally advanced rectal cancer were examined retrospectively. Surgical resection was carried out 6-9 weeks following CRT. The histopathological response to neoadjuvant treatment was determined according to the modified Mandard score. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the relationship between the expression of the five cited proteins in the pre-operative samples as well as various clinical parameters and the histopathological regression of the tumors. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (48%) were good responders, and 33 patients (52%) were found to respond poorly to neoadjuvant therapy. Among patients undergoing surgery 7 weeks following CRT, there were significantly more good responders than among patients who underwent surgery sooner (63% vs. 37%). High levels of expression of GHRH-R and Hsp90 were shown to be significantly correlated with minor or absent histological regression. CONCLUSIONS: GHRH-R and Hsp90 were found to be independent predictive factors of histopathological response to neoadjuvant RCT. Since GHRH-R antagonists and Hsp90 inhibitors are currently being tested as potential anticancer agents, our study implies the possible elaboration of an effective and individualized treatment of poor responders.

381	The role of epithelial mesenchymal transition and resistance to neoadjuvant therapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2014	24617665	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24617665	Journal Article	\N	69	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy-native patients received long-course neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) administered as long-course fractionated radiotherapy to a maximum dose of 54 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy (either ﬂuorouracil- or capecitabine-based regimes). Patients were fully restaged 6-8 weeks following completion of neoCRT. Surgery was performed no later than 6 weeks after the last complete radiological staging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: Nonresponse to neoadjuvant therapy is a significant challenge for clinicians managing solid cancers. This study aimed to determine whether epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) was associated with nonresponse to neoadjuvant therapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. METHOD: Representative tissue specimens from the tumour-invasive front of consecutive patients undergoing resection of rectal cancer from 2009 to 2011 were used. Patients with marked regression to neoadjuvant therapy were classified as responders and the remainder were classified as nonresponders. Markers of EMT included reduced immunohistochemical expression of membranous E-cadherin, increased nuclear beta-catenin expression and tumour budding. In-situ hybridization was used to assess the expression of microRNA-200c (mir200c), an upstream master-regulator of EMT. RESULTS: Of 103 patients undergoing resection of rectal cancer, 69 received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy; 65% of these were nonresponders. Reduced expression of mir200c was significantly associated with a higher T grade. Reduced membranous E-cadherin, increased nuclear beta-catenin and tumour budding individually predicted the presence of extramural vascular invasion. Reduced E-cadherin, nucleic beta-catenin, reduced expression of mir200c and tumour budding were all significantly associated with nonresponse to neoadjuvant therapy (all P < 0.001). Reduced E-cadherin and expression of mir200c were both associated with reduced cancer-specific survival (log-rank P-values 0.036 and 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSION: Targeted biomarkers of EMT were associated with nonresponse to neoadjuvant therapy and reduced survival in advanced rectal cancer. EMT may provide a practical clinical biomarker and a novel therapeutic target to improve the proportion of patients who respond to neoadjuvant therapy.	Colorectal Disease	\N

Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: Bcl-2 and bax are proteins with opposing roles in apoptosis regulation; yet abnormal expression of either has been associated with failure after radiotherapy (RT). In this study we examined bcl-2 and bax expression as predictive markers in men treated with radiotherapy +/- androgen deprivation on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 86-10. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Suitable archival diagnostic tissue was obtained from 119 (26%) patients for bcl-2 analysis and 104 (23%) patients for bax analysis. Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis was used to determine the relationship of abnormal bcl-2 and bax expression to the end points of local failure, distant metastasis, cause-specific mortality, and overall mortality. Bcl-2 overexpression was classified as any tumor cell cytoplasmic staining and altered bax expression was classified as greater or lesser cytoplasmic staining intensity of tumor cells as compared with adjacent normal prostate epithelium. RESULTS: The study cohort exhibited bcl-2 overexpression in 26% (n = 30) of cases and abnormal bax expression in 47% (n = 49) of cases. A borderline significant relationship was observed between abnormal bax expression and higher Gleason score (p = 0.08). In univariate and multivariate analyses, there was no statistically significant relationship seen between abnormal bcl-2 or bax expression and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal bcl-2 and bax expression were not related to any of the end points tested. The cohort examined was comprised of patients with locally advanced disease and it is possible that these markers may be of greater value in men with earlier-stage prostate cancer.

A cluster of >20 positive tumor cells was considered BCL2 overexpression.	Patients treated with radiotherapy or short-term androgendeprivation + radiotherapy (STAD+RT).	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: Bcl-2 is antiapoptotic, and its overexpression has been associated with resistance to androgen deprivation and poor outcome in some patients treated with radiotherapy. Bax is proapoptotic, regulating Bcl-2 through heterodimer formation. In a prior study, Bcl-2 and Bax were not related to outcome in locally advanced patients treated with radiotherapy or short-term androgen deprivation + radiotherapy (STAD+RT) on another Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial (86-10). A follow-up investigation was carried out here in more contemporary high-risk men treated on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 92-02 with STAD+RT or long-term AD+RT (LTAD+RT). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Adequate tissue was available to be analyzed immunohistochemically in 502 patients for Bcl-2 and 343 patients for Bax. Univariate and multivariate analyses by Cox proportional hazards models were applied to end points of failure. RESULTS: Bcl-2 was positive in 45.6% cases, and Bax expression altered in 53.9% cases. Abnormal Bcl-2 was not related to any of the failure end points tested. Altered Bax expression was significantly associated with any failure (P = 0.023) and marginally with biochemical failure (P = 0.085). The combination of negative Bcl-2/normal Bax expression seemed more robust, being significantly related to reduced biochemical failure (P = 0.036) and any failure (P = 0.046). The predictive value of negative Bcl-2/normal Bax was most pronounced in those who received STAD+RT, as opposed to LTAD+RT. CONCLUSIONS: Normal Bax expression was associated with significantly more favorable outcome. The combination of negative Bcl-2 and normal Bax was more consistently significant, particularly when STAD+RT was the treatment administered. These data suggest that LTAD+RT should be used when either Bcl-2 or Bax is abnormally expressed.	Clinical Cancer Research	T2: 219 patients, T3-4: 283 patients.

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may protect against damage by irradiation that would justify the use of COX-2 inhibitors. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential role of COX-2 in tumor response and outcome of patients with rectal cancer treated preoperatively with radiotherapy. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined COX-2 expression in 88 surgical specimens of rectal cancer treated preoperatively and in 26 pretherapeutic biopsies. We tested whether COX-2 expression was correlated with clinico-pathologic parameters and with survival and local recurrence. COX-2 was expressed in 50% of the pretherapeutic tumor biopsies and in 88.6% of post-irradiated surgical samples. COX-2 expression was correlated only with enhanced tumor inflammation (p = 0.03) and with tumor volume exceeding 30 cc (p = 0.05). COX-2 was not significantly correlated with patient survival, but none of the patients with COX-2 negative tumors did recur locally, whereas 80% of patients with local recurrences have COX-2 positive tumors. We conclude that COX-2 expression is overexpressed in the majority of rectal cancers treated with radiotherapy and likely plays a role in local relapse.

385	Estrogen-dependent prognostic significance of cyclooxygenase-2 expression in early-stage invasive breast cancers treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation	English	2008	18262731	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18262731	Journal Article	White; African American; Other	504	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The PTGS2 staining is primarily cytoplasmic, and the intensity of PTGS2 staining was scored as 0 (no immunoreactivity), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong) in tumor cells. Cases scored with 0 and 1 were considered as a group as negative expression levels, whereas cases scored with 2 and 3 with more than 10% of cells staining were considered as a group as positive. Both estrogen and progesterone receptor status were assessed by standard immunohistochemical methods and were scored as positive if there was greater than 10% nuclear staining.	After breast-conserving surgery, patients were treated with standard daily whole breast irradiation, with or without regional nodal irradiation. Patients were treated with a daily fraction size of 2.0 Gy, to a total median dose of 48 Gy to the whole breast, routinely followed by an electron cone-down to a total median dose of 64.0 Gy. Regional nodes were treated toa total median dose of 46 Gy, as clinically indicated and previously described. Adjuvant systemic chemotherapy and/or adjuvant hormone therapy was administered as clinically indicated in accordance with standard practices during this time interval. Estrogen receptor-positive patients receiving chemotherapy also routinely were treated with adjuvant hormonal therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in breast cancer patients treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy (CS+RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1975 and 2003, we retrieved specimens from 504 breast cancer patients treated with CS+RT. The specimens were constructed into tissue microarrays processed and stained for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, Her2/neu, and COX-2. Each core was scored as positive or negative. All data including demographics, clinical, pathologic, staging, and outcome variables were entered into a computerized database. RESULTS: Expression of COX-2 was positive in 58% of cases and correlated with younger age (p = 0.01) and larger tumor size (p = 0.001). Expression of COX-2 was predictive of local relapse (relative risk[RR], 3.248; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.340-7.871; p = 0.0091), distant metastasis (RR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.259-3.896; p = 0.0058), and decreased survival (RR, 2.321; 95% CI, 1.324-4.071; p = 0.0033). Among ER-positive patients, COX-2 expression was predictive of worse local control (85% vs. 93%, p = 0.04), distant metastasis (75% vs. 95%, p = 0.002) and worse survival (65% vs. 94%, p = 0.002). Among ER-negative tumors COX-2 expression was not significantly correlated with local control (87 vs. 95%, p = 0.12), distant metastasis (73% vs. 78%, p = 0.39), or survival (77% vs. 87%, p = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: In breast cancer patients treated with CS+RT, COX-2 expression is associated with younger age, larger tumor size, worse local control, distant metastasis, and worse overall survival. The significance is limited to hormone receptor-positive tumors, consistent with the known effect of COX-2/PGE2 on aromatase activity. Use of COX-2 inhibitors in estrogen-dependent breast cancers warrants further investigation.	International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics	T1: 352 patients, T2: 103 patients.

All patients received preoperative chemotherapy with FAC (5-fluorouracil 500 mg/㎡ intravenously [I.V.] on days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/㎡ I.V. continuous infusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/㎡ I.V. on day 1, every 3 weeks) for 3-6 courses. Twenty-five patients (66%) also received a taxane (paclitaxel 175-250 mg/㎡ or docetaxel 100 mg/㎡ every 21 days). All patients underwent modified radical mastectomy. All patients received postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall. Fourteen patients with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer received adjuvant hormonal treatment with tamoxifen for 5 years.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether p27kip1 downregulation is a prognostic factor in patients with inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with IBC were treated between January 1994 and July 2002. Median age was 49 years. Thirty-eight patients had baseline biopsy specimens. Patients received preoperative chemotherapy with FAC (5-fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide; 34%) or FAC followed by a taxane (66%). All patients underwent mastectomies. All patients received radiation therapy and hormonal treatment when indicated. Expression level of p27kip1 was evaluated by indirect immunoperoxidase procedure. The p27kip1 was considered downregulated if nuclear staining was present in < 50% of the neoplastic cells. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (84%) had p27kip1-downregulated tumors, and 6 patients (17%) had p27kip1-normal tumors. Six patients (16%) exhibited a pathologic complete response. At a median follow-up of 43 months, 25 recurrences (66%) and 27 deaths (71%) occurred. Patients with p27kip1-downregulated tumors had fewer pathologic complete responses (9% vs. 50%; P = 0.03) and had lower 4-year recurrence-free survival (23% vs. 83%; P = 0.03) and overall survival rates (36% vs. 83%; P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The p27kip1 deregulation manifested by low protein cellular concentration might represent an adverse prognostic marker in IBC and could provide a valuable tool for selecting treatment for this aggressive disease.

387	Evaluation of prognostic factors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (stage II-III) after concurrent chemoradiotherapy using biopsy specimens	English	2007	17709606	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17709606	Journal Article	\N	51	42	9	68	\N	[43.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The immunoreactivity of EGFR was graded into four groups according to the intensity of cell membrane EGFR staining in the whole tumor: high (markedly stronger staining than normal esophageal epithelium), medium (moderately stronger staining), low (the same staining level as normal epithelium) and negative (fainter staining). Strong and moderate staining groups were deﬁned as positive for EGFR expression. VEGFA staining was graded as follows: (a) +, staining intensity in cancer cells was stronger than that in stromal cells; (b) ±, staining intensity in cancer cells was equal to that in stromal cells; and (c) -, staining intensity in cancer cells was weaker than that in stromal cells. The cases graded as + were deﬁned as positive. The percentages of CCND1-positive tumor cells were calculated by counting the number of brownstained tumor nuclei/total number of cancer cells in the most highly stained area on a high-power view (x400). Cut-off values were determined by the following estimation: CCND1-positive judgment was a more than 30% labeling index. PCNA was calculated as the percentage of PCNA-positive cancer cells by counting more than 1000 cancer cells in more than three ﬁelds of a specimen with x400 magniﬁcation microscopy without knowing any clinical information. For the endoscopic biopsy specimens, PCNA were counted at the site of the maximum number of positive nuclei in the whole tumor. Only strong nuclear staining was regarded as positive, and weak nuclear or cytoplasmic staining was regarded as negative. The PCNA index was the percentage of nuclei staining positive. A PCNA score greater than 40 was taken as PCNA-positive. Also, tumors in which positive nuclei were observed in 20% or more cells were considered to be overexpressing TP53. 	Chemotherapy consisted of the protracted infusion of 5-FU 400 mg/㎡ /day on days 1–5 and 8–12 combined with CDDP 40 mg/㎡ with adequate hydration and antiemetic coverage on days 1 and 8. This schedule was repeated twice every 5 weeks. Radiation therapy using megavoltage X-rays was started on day 1 concomitantly with chemotherapy. The planned target volume for carcinoma of the upper or middle third esophagus included the primary tumor with a 3 cm margin craniocaudally, metastatic nodes with a 1–1.5 cm margin, supraclavicular fossa and mediastinum. For carcinoma of the lower third esophagus, the ﬁeld was extended to include the perigastric nodes, and the supraclavicular fossa was excluded if the cervical nodes tested negative. When the planned volume included both the supraclavicular fossa and upper abdominal nodes, a daily dose of 2.0 Gy was allowed. A 2-week interval took place after a dose of 30 Gy. Radiation therapy was restarted on day 36 along with the same schedule of chemotherapy as before. The irradiation techniques used were anterior- and posterior-opposed equally weighted beams up to a dose of 40 Gy. Then, the radiation portals were changed to shield the spinal cord and to craniocaudally encompass the primary tumor with a 2–3 cm margin. Metastatic nodes were encompassed with a 1–1.5 cm margin. The radiation dose to the spinal cord was kept at a maximum of 50 Gy. The homogeneity of the dose within the planned target volume was within ±10% of the prescribed dose. For patients treated with prophylactic ﬁlgrastim, a daily dose of 75 mg/total body was administered subcutaneously during the period between days 18 and 31. The treatment was discontinued when disease progression, patient refusal or delay of recovery from the toxicity in excess of 6 weeks from the initiation of the treatment occurred. Five patients underwent surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Recently, attention has been directed to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus with regard to efficacy, quality of life and functional preservation, and survival periods comparable to those after standard surgical therapy have been reported in responders to CRT. However, there are some non-responders to CRT, and the prediction of the outcome after CRT is an important subject for future studies. In this study, using biopsy specimens obtained before CRT, we evaluated the relationships between biological markers and the outcome after CRT in order to determine the prognostic factors of CRT. METHODS: The subjects were 51 patients (42 males and nine females: median age 68 years). who were histologically confirmed to have squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus at stage II or III (UICC). Concurrent CRT consisting of chemotherapy using 5FU and CDDP and radiation therapy (60 Gy) was performed as the initial treatment, and the relationships of overexpression of EGFR, p53, VEGF, PCNA and CyclinD1 were examined immunohistochemically in biopsy specimens collected before treatment. Overall survival was estimated by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The percentages of patients overexpressing p53, VEGF, PCNA, CyclinD1, and EGFR were 33, 31, 37, 31 and 29%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, T stage (P = 0.0393) and PCNA (P = 0.0302) were found to be significant prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: PCNA overexpression appears to be a prognostic factor for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus after CRT.

Our radiotherapy treatment policy for esophageal carcinoma was to perform external beam irradiation with 60 Co γ ray to primary tumor by simulation according to barium esophagography and CT scan, and use one 7.0 cm wide anteroposterior and two 6.0 cm wide oblique opposites and more than 3.0-4.0 cm over tumor length with isocenter and source-skin distance irradiation. The dose was fractionated into 2 Gy, 5 fractions per week for a total dose of 60-65 Gy.	Radiotherapy	5	Objective: To evaluate the expression and correlation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Survivin proteins in biopsy specimens of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and then determine whether the levels of expression of these proteins could predict the clinical effectiveness of radiotherapy in individual cancers. Methods: The expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF and Survivin were shown by S-P immunohistochemical staining method in biopsy specimens of ESCC, which were obtained endoscopically from 50 patients before radiotherapy, and 10 cases of normal esophageal tissue. Results: The positive expression rates of HIF-1α, VEGF and Survivin were 68%, 74% and 72% in ESCC respectively. However, the three tumor markers had negative expressions in normal esophageal tissue. The positive rate of HIF-1α was positively correlated with VEGF and Survivin proteins. The positive rates of HIF-1α and Survivin were closely related to the clinical stage, radiotherapy effectiveness and survival, otherwise, the expression of HIF-1α was closely related to distant metastasis; both of them were no correlation with the differentiation degree of tumor. The effective rates of radiotherapy and mean survival periods of those cases with positive and negative expressions of HIF-1α were 8.8%, 10 months and 81.25%, 25 months, respectively. The one, two, and three years survival rates of patients with positive and negative expressions of HIF-1α were 38.2%, 5.9%, 2.9%, and 81.3%, 54.2%, 15.8%, respectively (P = 0.001). Patients with HIF-1α positive expression obviously survived less than those with negative expression and the difference was significant. The expression of VEGF was only related to the distant metastasis. Conclusion: Over expressions of HIF-1α, VEGF and Survivin were found in ESCC. The positive rate of HIF-1α was positively correlated with VEGF and Survivin proteins. The expression of HIF-1α may serve as an important parameter in evaluating response for radiotherapy and prognosis of ESCC. It may play an important role by up-regulating the transcription of VEGF and Survivin genes.	Chinese-German Journal of Clinical Oncology	Stage II: 9 patients, Stage III-IV: 31 patients.

The sum of the intensity and distribution score was used as the final staining score. Tumors with a final score of ≥3 were considered high expression.	Patients undergo the preoperative radiotherapy (20 Gy given in five daily doses of 4 Gy), followed by radical surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The ability to predict tumor sensitivity toward radiotherapy is important in the personalized application of preoperative radiotherapy for patients with rectal cancer. The aim of the present study was to test the human phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 4 (hPEBP4) as a predictive marker of tumor response to preoperative radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted, consisting of 86 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent short-course preoperative radiotherapy (20 Gy in five fractions for 1 week) followed by a radical resection. Both pretreatment biopsy specimens and resected primary tumor tissue were collected. Immunohistochemistry and tumor regression grading system were used to evaluate the expression of hPEBP4 in the pretreatment biopsy specimens and the response of rectal cancer to radiotherapy, respectively. Expression of hPEBP4 was correlated with tumor regression in the resected specimen and the clinical outcome of the patients as well. RESULTS: We found that high expression of hPEBP4 was associated with radioresistance in both univariate and multivariate analyses, and patients with a high hPEBP4 expression had a poorer progression-free survival than those with low hPEBP4 expression. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed the independent predictive values of hPEBP4 in response of rectal cancer to preoperative radiotherapy, which suggests that upregulating hPEBP4 might be a potential mechanism by which rectal cancer cells avoid the destructive effects of radiotherapy.

The staining intensity was classified into 4 grades: 0 (no staining), 1 (yellow), 2 (deep yellow) and 3 (brown). The intensity and percentage of positively stained tumor cells were scored after counting at least 10 high-power fields at 200×, the points for percentage of positive cells and staining intensity were added, and the specimens were classified into two groups according to their overall score: negative expression for 0-1 point and positive expression for 2-6 points.	The patients received concurrent radiation and chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of cisplatin 25 mg/㎡ infusion on days 1-3, 5-FU 500 mg/㎡/day as a continuous infusion on days 1 to 5, and a total dose of 59.4 Gy delivered at 1.8 Gy/d, 5 days per week.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Autophagy is a bulk protein and organelle degradation process essential for cellular maintenance, cell viability and development. This study investigated the prognostic role of LC3 and Beclin-1, two autophagy-related proteins, in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive chemoradiation. The data of 150 patients with stages II-IVa ESCC who had undergone definitive concurrent chemoradiation were studied; LC3 and Beclin-1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The correlations between LC3 and Beclin-1 expression, the patients' clinicopathological features, and overall survival were analyzed. Eighty-three patients showed positive LC3 and 84 showed positive Beclin-1 protein expressions, but LC3 and Beclin-1 expression in ESCC was not significantly correlated (P=0.746). LC3 and Beclin-1 expression did not show any association with gender, age, tumor location, and treatment response. The median survival of patients with positive LC3 expression was 23.6 months, while the median survival was 32.0 months in patients with negative LC3 expression (P=0.049). The patients with LC3 and Beclin-1-positive tumors presented much poorer long-term survival. Multivariate analysis showed that clinical stage (P=0.019), treatment response (P=0.002), and LC3 expression level (P=0.021) were independent predictive factors of overall survival in patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving definitive chemoradiation. Patients with LC3 and Beclin-1-negative expression had a better overall survival than those with LC3 and Beclin-1-positive tumors. LC3 expression is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in ESCC patients treated with definitive chemoradiation.

It is important to predict the response because the treatment has side effects and is costly. The aim of this study was to establish the relationship among clinical, pathologic, and molecular biomarkers and the response to neoadjuvant therapy. METHOD: A total of 130 patients with locally advanced mid and low rectal cancer who underwent long-course radiotherapy with 5-FU based chemotherapy followed by radical surgical resection were included in the study. Clinical and pathologic data were collected. Paraffin-embedded sections obtained in diagnostic biopsies were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for molecular markers and classified using a semiquantitative method. Results were related with T-downstaging and tumor regression grade using Mandard scoring system on surgical specimens. RESULTS: Pathologic complete response was found in 19 patients (14.6%), while in another 18 (13.8%) only minor residual disease was seen in the rectal wall. T-downstaging was observed in 63 (48.5%). The average of lymph node retrieval in the surgical specimens was 9.4. Regarding predictive markers of response, there was significant correlation between the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (P = 0.005), β-catenin (P = 0.03), vascular endothelial growth factor (P = 0.048) and apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (P = 0.03), tumor differentiation grade (P < 0.001), and response in the univariate analysis. T-downstaging was associated with vascular endothelial growth factor expression (P = 0.03) and tumor differentiation grade (P < 0.001). Significant parameters found in the multivariate analysis were tumor differentiation grade and Bcl-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic and molecular biomarkers in the diagnostic biopsies may help us predict tumor response to chemoradiation in rectal cancer patients.	Journal of Surgical Research	\N
394	P27 does not predict histopathological response to radiochemotherapy in rectal cancer	English	2003	12957127	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12957127	Journal Article	\N	42	35	7	61	60	[39.0,71.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were evaluated separately for intensity (none, weak, moderate, marked: -, +, ++, +++), and the percentage of positive cells (% of total biopsy volume). For statistical testing, intensity values were dichotomized into low (-/+) versus high (++/+++) intensity.	Radiotherapy was delivered by a linear accelerator generating 6-10 MV photons, employing a three-field technique with individually shaped portals and daily fractions of 1.8 Gy on 5 consecutive days per week. As specified in the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) 50 report, all patients received a total dose of 50.40 Gy to the tumor and the true pelvis. During the first (days 1-5) and fifth (days 29-33) week of radiotherapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was delivered concomitantly at a dose of 1000 mg/㎡/d (maximum 1800 mg) as a continuous infusion over 120 h. Patients were scheduled to undergo surgery 6 weeks after completion of preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCT). Following complete resection (R0), four cycles of postoperative maintainance chemotherapy were applied, in the form of a 5-FU (500 mg/㎡/d intraversus bolus on 5 consecutive days). All patients completed the preoperative RCT protocol as scheduled. In four patients with unresectable distant metastases, 5-FU/folinic acid high-dose chemotherapy was administered postoperatively.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Tumor response to radiochemotherapy (RCT) varies considerably, even among patients treated in accordance with the same protocol. The aim of the present study was to test the predictive value of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27kip1 with regard to neoadjuvant RCT response in rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P27kip1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in pretreatment biopsy material obtained from 42 patients with rectal cancer treated uniformly in accordance with an identical prospective neoadjuvant RCT protocol (CAO/AIO/ARO-94). Four expression patterns (staining intensity [-,+,++,+++] and the percentage of positive cells, evaluated separately for nuclei and cytoplasm) of p27kip1 were investigated for correlation with tumor response, which was assessed in the resected surgical specimen using a histopathological five-point grading system. Additionally, p27(kip1) expression was investigated for correlation with several pathological features, overall survival, and disease-free survival. RESULTS: p27kip1 expression was as follows: nuclear intensity: -: 8, +: 19, ++: 11, +++: 4 cases, median percentage of positive cells: 18.75%; cytoplasmic intensity: -: 0, +: 25, ++: 12, +++: 3 cases, median percentage of positive cells: 70%. Histopathological tumor regression was acceptable in 30 patients (3 complete; 27 good) and inadequate in 12 patients (7 moderate; 5 minimal). No tumor failed to show some regression. No significant correlation was found between any of the p27kip1 expression patterns and RCT response, tumor differentiation (low grade versus high grade), cT- and ypT-category, UICC stage, overall survival, and disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: p27kip1 cannot aid the individualization of multimodal treatment strategies in rectal cancer, nor can it serve as a predictor of survival.

395	Ki-67 staining index predicts distant metastasis and survival in locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy: an analysis of patients in radiation therapy oncology group protocol 86-10	English	2004	15217948	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15217948	Journal Article	\N	108	108	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy alone (EBRT, external beam radiation therapy) was administered to 60 patients, and 48 cases received AD (androgen deprivation) + EBRT.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: Proliferative activity defined by Ki-67 staining index (SI) has been correlated with progression and prognosis in a number of malignant tumors including prostate cancer. However, few studies have examined Ki-67 SI in pretreatment diagnostic material from patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. In a prior study, we found that a Ki-67 SI of >3.5% was associated with poorer patient outcome. The goals of this analysis were to validate the prognostic value of Ki-67 SI and this cut point. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Of 456 assessable patients in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 86-10, diagnostic material from 108 patients was available for Ki-67 analysis using MIB-1 antibody. Sixty patients were treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) alone, and 48 patients were treated with short-term androgen deprivation + EBRT. Median follow-up was 9 years for those living. The relationship of Ki-67 with distant metastasis (DM), disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival (OS) was examined. RESULTS: The median Ki-67 SI was 7.1% (range, 0.2-45.5%). The 7.1% cut point was associated with DM and DSS; however, the 3.5% cut point was as strong a determinant and was the focus of this analysis. In Cox proportional hazards regression, Ki-67 SI was independently associated with DM and DSS. When the Ki-67 SI was </=3.5% and >3.5%, the 5-year risk of DM was 13.5% and 50.8% (P = 0.0005), respectively, and the 5-year risk of DSS was 97.3% and 67.7% (P = 0.0039), respectively. No association of Ki-67 SI with OS was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Higher Ki-67 SI was significantly associated with a greater risk of DM and DSS in locally advanced prostate cancer after definitive EBRT or AD + EBRT.

396	Ki-67 staining is a strong predictor of distant metastasis and mortality for men with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Trial 92-02	English	2004	15169799	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15169799	Journal Article	\N	537	537	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	STAD (short term androgen deprivation) was begun 2 months before RT (radiotherapy) and was continued during RT. Total androgen deprivation was accomplished with flutamide at 750 mg/d plus an LHRH agonist. The initial first 4 months of LTAD (long term androgen deprivation) were structured identically to the first 4 months of STAD, and then an additional 24 months of LHRH agonist was given after the completion of RT.The prescription RT dose was 65 to 70 Gy in both arms. The whole pelvis was treated to 44 to 46 Gy, followed by an additional 20 to 26 Gy to the prostate. The median RT dose was 68.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: The Ki-67 staining index (Ki67-SI) has been associated with prostate cancer patient outcome; however, few studies have involved radiotherapy (RT) -treated patients. The association of Ki67-SI to local failure (LF), biochemical failure (BF), distant metastasis (DM), cause-specific death (CSD) and overall death (OD) was determined in men randomly assigned to short term androgen deprivation (STAD) + RT or long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD) + RT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: There were 537 patients (35.5%) on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 92-02 who had sufficient tissue for Ki67-SI analysis. Median follow-up was 96.3 months. Ki67-SI cut points of 3.5% and 7.1% were previously found to be related to patient outcome and were examined here in a Cox proportional hazards multivariate analysis (MVA). Ki67-SI was also tested as a continuous variable. Covariates were dichotomized in accordance with stratification and randomization criteria. RESULTS: Median Ki67-SI was 6.5% (range, 0% to 58.2%). There was no difference in the distribution of patients in the Ki-67 analysis cohort (n = 537) and the other patients in RTOG 92-02 (n = 977) by any of the covariates or end points tested. In MVAs, Ki67-SI (continuous) was associated with LF (P =.08), BF (P =.0445), DM (P <.0001), CSD (P <.0001), and OD (P =.0094). When categoric variables were used in MVAs, the 3.5% Ki67-SI cut point was not significant. The 7.1% cut point was related to BF (P =.09), DM (P =.0008), and CSD (P =.017). Ki67-SI was the most significant correlate of DM and CSD. A detailed analysis of the hazard rates for DM in all possible covariate combinations revealed subgroups of patients treated with STAD + RT that did not require LTAD. CONCLUSION: Ki67-SI was the most significant determinant of DM and CSD and was also associated with OD. The Ki67-SI should be considered for the stratification of patients in future trials.

397	MDM2 and Ki-67 predict for distant metastasis and mortality in men treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation for prostate cancer: RTOG 92-02	English	2009	19470936	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19470936	Journal Article	\N	478	478	\N	70	\N	[44.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	RTOG 92-02 was a randomized trial that compared LTAD (long term androgen deprivation) (28months) with STAD (short term androgen deprivation) (4months) in addition to radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.	Radiotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE MDM2 regulates p53, which controls cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Both proteins, along with Ki-67, which is an established strong determinant of metastasis, have shown promise in predicting the outcome of men treated with radiation therapy (RT) with or without short-term androgen deprivation (STAD). This report compares the utility of abnormal expression of these biomarkers in estimating progression in a cohort of men treated on RTOG 92-02. PATIENTS AND METHODS Adequate tissue for immunohistochemistry was available for p53, Ki-67, and MDM2 analyses in 478 patient cases. The percentage of tumor nuclei staining positive (PSP) was quantified manually or by image analysis, and the per-sample mean intensity score (MIS) was quantified by image analysis. Cox regression models were used to estimate overall mortality (OM), and Fine and Gray's regressions were applied to the end points of distant metastasis (DM) and cause-specific mortality (CSM). Results In multivariate analyses that adjusted for all markers and treatment covariates, MDM2 overexpression was significantly related to DM (P = .02) and OM (P = .003), and Ki-67 overexpression was significantly related to DM (P < .0001), CSM (P = .0007), and OM (P = .01). P53 overexpression was significantly related to OM (P = .02). When considered in combination, the overexpression of both Ki-67 and MDM2 at high levels was associated with significantly increased failure rates for all end points (P < .001 for DM, CSM, and OM). CONCLUSION Combined MDM2 and Ki-67 expression levels were independently related to distant metastasis and mortality and, if validated, could be considered for risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer in clinical trials.

398	Prognostic value of p16 in locally advanced prostate cancer: a study based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 9202	English	2007	17634487	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17634487	Journal Article	\N	612	612	\N	70	\N	[43.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients received external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to the whole pelvis followed by aboost to the prostate.With regard to hormone therapy, before EBRT, all patients received monthly flutamide 250 mg orally tid with monthly goserelin acetate 3.6 mg subcutaneously until EBRT was completed.The patients were then  randomly assigned to receive no further treatment (short term androgen deprivation plus radiotherapy) or to receive goserelin acetate 3.6 mg subcutaneously monthly for an additional 2 years after the completion of EBRT (long term androgen deprivation plus radiotherapy).	Radiotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: Deregulation of the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway is commonly found in virtually all known human tumors. p16, the upstream regulator of RB, is among the most commonly affected member of this pathway. In the present study, we examined the prognostic value of p16 expression in men with locally advanced prostate cancer who were enrolled on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 9202. PATIENTS AND METHODS: RTOG 9202 was a phase III randomized study comparing long-term (LT) versus short-term (ST) androgen-deprivation therapy (AD). Of the 1,514 eligible cases, 612 patients had adequate tumor material for p16 analysis. Expression levels of p16 were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). IHC staining was scored quantitatively using an image analysis system. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, intact p16 expression was significantly associated with decreased rate of distant metastases (P = .0332) when both STAD and LTAD treatment arms were considered together. For patients with intact (high levels of immunostaining) p16 (mean p16 index > 81.3%), LTAD plus radiotherapy (RT) significantly improved prostate cancer survival (PCS) compared with STAD plus RT (P = .0008) and reduced the frequency of distant metastasis (P = .0069) compared with STAD plus RT. In contrast, for patients with tumors demonstrating p16 loss (low levels of immunostaining, mean p16 index < or = 81.3%), LTAD plus RT significantly improved biochemical no evidence of disease survival over STAD (P < .0001) primarily by decreasing the frequency of local progression (P = .02), as opposed to distant metastasis, which was the case in the high-p16 cohort. CONCLUSION: Low levels of p16 on image analysis appear to be associated with a significantly higher risk of distant metastases among all study patients. p16 expression levels also appear to identify patients with locally advanced prostate cancer with distinct patterns of failure after LTAD.

399	Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 is associated with radioresistance in oral squamous cell carcinoma	English	2004	14969817	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14969817	Journal Article	\N	41	24	17	\N	62.6000000000000014	[29.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	All cases were assigned to one of four subgroups: (a) 0: positive cells were less than 5% and/or staining was missing; (b) 1+: positive cells were 5-25% and the staining was weak; (c) 2+: positive cells were 25-50% and the staining was moderate; (d) 3+: positive cells were more than 50% and the staining was pronounced.	Preoperative external irradiation was performed with a dose of 2 Gy/fraction, ﬁve times per week, with total doses ranging from 18 to 40 Gy (mean 33.5 Gy). All patients underwent surgery 2-3 weeks after the preoperative radiation therapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase, is overexpressed in many types of malignant tumors, which in turn may stimulate tumor growth and protect against damage by irradiation or cytotoxic agents. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the radiation sensitivity and elevated level of COX-2. Radiation sensitivity of the eight oral SCC cell lines differed greatly in their response to radiation. Further, the level of the COX-2 expression correlated inversely with increased tumor radiation sensitivity. The similar significant association between the response to preoperative radiation therapy and COX-2 overexpression was observed in the oral SCC patients. In addition, treatment with a COX-2 selective inhibitor enhanced the radioresponse of HSC-2 cell, which constitutively expressed COX-2. These results suggested that COX-2 expression level correlates to radiation tolerance and the COX-2 selective inhibitor may be a potent enhancer for tumor radioresponse in oral SCC.

400	Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α predicts clinical outcome after preoperative hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2011	22104271	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22104271	Journal Article	\N	50	38	12	59	\N	[37.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Cases with over 40% positive cells were rated as positive.	All patients in this study underwent preoperative chemoradiotherapy combined with hyperthermia treatment. External beam radiotherapy was delivered by 10 MV X-ray through an anteroposterior or three- or four-field box technique. The clinical target volume (CTV) encompassed the primary tumor and entire mesorectal tissue. The total radia tion dose was 40-50 Gy, with daily fractions of 2 Gy. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU (250 mg/㎡ per day) and leucovorin (LV) (25 mg/㎡ per day) administered by continuous infusion on Day 1-5, Day 15-19, and Day 29-33 during radiotherapy. Hyperthermia was performed for once a week for 2-5 sessions (median 5 sessions) with 8 MHz radiofrequency capacitive heating equipment (Thermotron-RF 8, Yamamoto Vinita Co. Ltd., Japan). Surgery, which was mainly total mesorectal excision, was performed 8 weeks after the completion of hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is an intrinsic marker of tumor hypoxia. It has been considered that hypoxic conditions reduce radiosensitivity, but the role of HIF-1α in patients treated with preoperative therapy for rectal cancer is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of tumor response to preoperative hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy (HCRT) and the prognostic significance of HIF-1α expression in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Between 2003 and 2006, 50 patients with histologically proven rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent HCRT followed by surgery were investigated. HIF-1α expression was immunohistochemically evaluated using pre-treatment biopsies. The total radiation dose was 40-50 Gy and chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU and LV administered by continuous infusion on Day 1-5, Day 15-19, and Day 29-33 during radiotherapy. Hyperthermia treatment was performed for once a week for 2-5 sessions. The surgical operation was performed 8 weeks after HCRT and each resected specimen was graded by histological criteria of the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. The effects of HIF-1α on clinical outcomes were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Positive HIF-1α expression was recognized in 42.0% of samples (21/50). Resected specimens that showed pathological grades 1, 2, and 3 numbered 17, 24, and 9 cases, respectively. There were no significant differences between the HIF-1α-positive group and HIF-1α-negative group for pathological grading and pCR. Overall survival (OS) rate at 3 years in the HIF-1α-negative group was 85.2%, which was significantly better than the 60.6% in the HIF-1α-positive group. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate at 3 years in the HIF-1α-negative group was 82.8%, being significantly better than 47.6% in the HIF-1α-positive group. In addition, elevated HIF-1α expression was significantly correlated with recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival rate in multivariate analysis. HIF-1α expression might be predictive of recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival rate for rectal cancer patients treated with HCRT.

Method From January 2012 to January 2014, 87 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients was studied in Qingdao Municipal Hospital. The expression of Ezrin, MACC1 and E-cadherin were detected by immunohistochemistry, and the relationship between the expression of Ezrin, MACC1, E-cadherin and the radiosensitivity and prognosis were analyzed. Result The expression of Ezrin, MACC1 and E-cadherin protein in cancer tissues were not significantly correlated with age and sex (P>0.05), and were significantly correlated with the clinical stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, histological type and differentiation type (P<0.05). The positive expression of Ezrin and MACC1 protein in cancer tissues were significantly higher than that in negative expression (P<0.05); the radiosensitivity of E-cadherin negative expression was significantly higher than that in positive expression (P<0.05). The combination of the three methods was more effective than single index in predicting radiosensitivity of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The 3 years survival rate of patients with positive expression of Ezrin and MACC1 protein was significantly lower than that of negative expression (P<0.05), and the 3 years survival rate of patients with E-cadherin negative expression was significantly lower than that of positive expression (P<0.05). Conclusion The expression of Ezrin, MACC1 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma and E-cadherin protein in nasopharyngeal carcinoma invasion and metastasis, can not only understand the patient's condition, and to assess the prognosis of patients, and the expression of Ezrin, MACC1 and E-cadherin protein may be a new target for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, providing new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

RTOG 92-02 was a randomized trial that compared LTAD (long term androgen deprivation) (28months) with STAD (short term androgen deprivation) (4months) in addition to radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer.	Radiotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to verify the significance of p53 as a prognostic factor in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9202, which compared short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) with radiation therapy (RT) to long-term androgen deprivation + RT in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (Pca). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tumor tissue was sufficient for p53 analysis in 777 cases. p53 status was determined by immunohistochemistry. Abnormal p53 expression was defined as 20% or more tumor cells with positive nuclei. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationships of p53 status to patient outcomes. RESULTS: Abnormal p53 was detected in 168 of 777 (21.6%) cases, and was significantly associated with cause-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 - 3.14; p = 0.014) and distant metastasis (adjusted HR = 1.72; 95% CI 1.13-2.62; p = 0.013). When patients were divided into subgroups according to assigned treatment, only the subgroup of patients who underwent STAD + RT showed significant correlation between p53 status and cause-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.32-4.49; p = 0.0044). When patients were divided into subgroups according to p53 status, only the subgroup of patients with abnormal p53 showed significant association between assigned treatment and cause-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 3.81; 95% CI 1.40-10.37; p = 0.0087). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal p53 is a significant prognostic factor for patients with prostate cancer who undergo short-term androgen deprivation and radiotherapy. Long-term androgen deprivation may significantly improve the cause-specific survival for those with abnormal p53.

402	COX-2 expression predicts prostate-cancer outcome: analysis of data from the RTOG 92-02 trial	English	2007	17881290	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881290	Journal Article	\N	586	586	\N	70	\N	[43.0,88.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Briefly, the RTOG 92-02 trial was a randomised trial studying long-term neoadjuvant concurrent and adjuvant androgen deprivation (28 months goserelin) versus short-term neoadjuvant and concurrent androgen deprivation (4 months goserelin and fl utamide) with external-beam radiotherapy (65-70 Gy to the prostate and 44-50 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes) in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (T2c-T4).	Radiotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: COX-2 is overexpressed in some cancers, including prostate cancer; however, little is known about the effect of COX-2 overexpression on outcome in radiation-treated patients with prostate cancer. We aimed to study COX-2 overexpression and outcome in a well-defined cohort of men who received treatment with short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) plus radiotherapy or long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD) plus radiotherapy. METHODS: Men with prostate cancer who had participated in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 92-02 trial and for whom sufficient diagnostic tissue was available for immunohistochemical staining and image analysis of COX-2 expression were enrolled in this study. Patients in the 92-02 trial had been randomly assigned to treatment with STAD plus radiotherapy or LTAD plus radiotherapy. Multivariate analyses by Cox proportional hazards models were done to assess whether associations existed between COX-2 staining intensity and the RTOG 92-02 primary endpoints of biochemical failure (assessed by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO] and Phoenix criteria), local failure, distant metastasis, cause-specific mortality, overall mortality, and any failure. FINDINGS: 586 patients with sufficient diagnostic tissue for immunohistochemical staining and image analysis of COX-2 expression were included in this study. In the multivariate analyses, the intensity of COX-2 staining as a continuous covariate was an independent predictor of distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.181 [95% CI 1.077-1.295], p=0.0004); biochemical failure by two definitions (ASTRO HR 1.073 [1.018-1.131], p=0.008; Phoenix HR 1.073 [1.014-1.134], p=0.014); and any failure (HR 1.068 [1.015-1.124], p=0.011). The higher the expression of COX-2, the greater the chance of failure. As a dichotomous covariate, COX-2 overexpression seemed to be most discriminating of outcome for those who received STAD compared with those who received LTAD. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first study to establish an association of COX-2 expression with outcome in patients with prostate cancer who have had radiotherapy. Increasing COX-2 expression was significantly associated with biochemical failure, distant metastasis, and any failure. COX-2 inhibitors might improve patient response to radiotherapy in those treated with or without androgen deprivation. Our findings suggest that LTAD might overcome the effects of COX-2 overexpression. Therefore, COX-2 expression might be useful in selecting patients who need LTAD.

All patients underwent primary radiotherapy with the intention of achieving cure. The treatment consisted of external beam radiotherapy with a four-field box technique to the pelvis and to the para-aortic region (depending on the stage), consisting of a total dose of 40-50 Gy (median, 48.6 Gy) applied in daily fractions of 1.6-2 Gy. External beam irradiation was carried out using a 25-MV linear accelerator, with central shielding in anterior-posterior portals, depending on the stage of disease and tumor volume. Three to six fractions of intracavitary high dose-rate brachytherapy were applied in weekly fractions of 7 Gy each to point “A,” depending on the tumor stage and tumor volume.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The purpose is to investigate the impact of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression on response to radiotherapy and prognosis of patients with primary irradiated cervical cancer. Because human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein E6 might interact with HIF-1alpha in various pathways, we also investigated the relation of HIF-1alpha and HPV status. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of HIF-1alpha was investigated by immunohistochemistry in 67 specimens of patients who had received radical radiotherapy for cervical cancer stages IB-IIIB. HPV analysis was performed using type-specific PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Survival analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed expression of HIF-1alpha in 72.1% of the tumor samples. In 16 (23.9%) cases, there was a weak expression, in 25 (37.3%) a moderate expression, and in 7 cases (10.4%) a strong expression of HIF-1alpha. Nineteen samples (28.4%) were considered negative for HIF-1alpha expression. Strong/moderate expression of HIF-1alpha was associated with only partial response to radiotherapy (P = 0.037, chi(2) test). Strong/moderate expression of HIF-1alpha was also an independent prognostic factor for shorter progression-free survival (P = 0.036, Cox regression) and cervical cancer-specific survival (P = 0.04, Cox regression). No association between HIF-1alpha expression and infection with different HPV types could be found. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of HIF-1alpha has predictive and prognostic significance in cervical cancer patients receiving curative radiation therapy. Possibly, expression of HIF-1alpha could serve as intrinsic marker of hypoxia in cervical cancer.	Clinical Cancer Research	Stage IB: 6 patients, Stage II: 34 patients, Stage III: 27 patients.
404	Cyclooxygenase-2 impairs treatment effects of radiotherapy for cervical cancer by inhibition of radiation-induced apoptosis	English	2006	16979845	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16979845	Journal Article	\N	47	\N	47	58	\N	[37.0,83.0)	Immunohistochemistry	If positive distributions of immunoreactivity accounted for more than 50%, the tissue specimens were classed as PTGS2 positive.	In brief, all patients underwent combination therapy with external beam irradiation of the entire pelvis and four sessions of high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy. Overall treatment time from initiation of irradiation to completion did not exceed 7 weeks. The external irradiation was administered with a linear accelerator using a 10-MV photon beam using anteroposterior and posteroanterior parallel opposite ports. Fractionation was a 1.8-Gy dose to the tumor daily, 5 fractions per week. A midline shield 3 cm wide at the central axis was inserted when the total dose reached 30.6 Gy. Irradiation was subsequently continued up to a total irradiation dose of 50.6 Gy with a dose of 2 Gy per fraction, 5 times per week. Brachytherapy was delivered with iridium-192 sources by a remote afterloading system. The first insertion was carried out after the midline shielding; the following 3 fractions were administered once per week with a fraction dose of 5 to 7 Gy at Point A. The total brachytherapy dose ranged from 23 to 28 Gy. Weekly chemotherapy consisting of 40 mg/㎡ of cisplatin was given concurrently with RT (radiotherapy) for 25 (53%) of the 47 patients in this study. In principle, chemotherapy was administered for patients with bulky tumors (tumor length >4 cm) or Stage III to IV disease, but RT alone was performed for patients with advanced disease who were considered unsuitable for concomitant chemotherapy after age and renal function were taken into consideration. With regard to use of anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac, a non-COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), was routinely administered immediately before each session of brachytherapy. Furthermore, 13 patients (28%) received non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs such as loxoprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen for relief of pain or inflammation during the course of RT treatment. All biopsy specimens were excised from the surface of non-necrotic cervical tumors before and 1 week after initiation of RT (a total dose of 9 Gy with or without a course of chemotherapy). All tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and subjected to a TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and immunohistochemical staining for COX-2.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays a pivotal role in regulation of radiation-induced apoptosis. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between COX-2 expression and postradiotherapy outcomes of patients with cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Biopsy specimens from 47 consecutive patients who had undergone definitive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy between October 2002 and November 2004 were investigated. RESULTS: The COX-2 expression rate of the pretreatment samples was 46.1% +/- 21.0%, and the apoptotic index (AI) 1 week after start of radiotherapy was 2.1% +/- 0.9%. There was a significant negative correlation between the pretreatment COX-2 expression and the AI during radiotherapy (r = -0.52, p = 0.0002). Complete response rates were 59% for COX-2-positive patients compared with 80% for COX-2-negative patients (p = 0.12). The 2-year local control rate for COX-2-positive patients was 71.3%, whereas the corresponding rate for COX-2-negative patients was 96.0% (p = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to prove clinically that COX-2 can make cervical squamous cell carcinomas more refractory to radiotherapy by inhibition of radiation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, expression of COX-2 may be a good indicator to predict local tumor control after radiotherapy. Although long-term results are ultimately needed, the combination therapy of radiotherapy with use of a COX-2 inhibitor could yield improved outcomes for patients with COX-2 expressing cervical cancer.

405	Significance of Cox-2 expression in rectal cancers with or without preoperative radiotherapy	English	2005	16199309	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16199309	Journal Article	\N	63	40	23	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Radiotherapy was given with 25 Gy in 5 fractions over a median of 6 days (range, 5-12 days), delivered with 6-10 MV photons. Surgery was then performed after a median of 3 days (range, 1-13 days) after the radiotherapy. None of the patients received adjuvant chemotherapy before surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Radiotherapy has reduced local recurrence of rectal cancers, but the result is not satisfactory. Further biologic factors are needed to identify patients for more effective radiotherapy. Our aims were to investigate the relationship of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) expression to radiotherapy, and clinicopathologic/biologic variables in rectal cancers with or without radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Cox-2 expression was immunohistochemically examined in distal normal mucosa (n = 28), in adjacent normal mucosa (n = 107), in primary cancer (n = 138), lymph node metastasis (n = 30), and biopsy (n = 85). The patients participated in a rectal cancer trial of preoperative radiotherapy. RESULTS: Cox-2 expression was increased in primary tumor compared with normal mucosa (p < 0.0001), but there was no significant change between primary tumor and metastasis. Cox-2 positivity was or tended to be related to more p53 and Ki-67 expression, and less apoptosis (p < or = 0.05). In Cox-2-negative cases of either biopsy (p = 0.01) or surgical samples (p = 0.02), radiotherapy was related to less frequency of local recurrence, but this was not the case in Cox-2-positive cases. CONCLUSION: Cox-2 expression seemed to be an early event involved in rectal cancer development. Radiotherapy might reduce a rate of local recurrence in the patients with Cox-2 weakly stained tumors, but not in those with Cox-2 strongly stained tumors.

METHODS: Ninety-four rectal cancer patients with preoperative chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in the Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University between January 2014 AND February 2016. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method was used to determined the expression of LRG5 mRNA befor and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the Log-rank test for univariate analysis. Cox regression analysis was performed to provide multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Tumor pathological regression reaction of rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was good. The efficacy was 87.2%, and 18.1% patients achieved pathological complete response rate (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The expression level of LGR5 mRNAS in rectal carcinoma tissues after chemoradiotherapy (8.847±6.664) was significantly less than before chemoradiotherapy (14.936±9.924, P<0.05). The expression level of LGR5 mRNA after chemoradiotherapy was up-regulated in 27 patients and down-regulated in 67 patients. Among them, the down-regulated group had significantly better tumor regression degree and 1, 2 year-survival rate than that of the up-regulated group. Univariate analysis showed that several factor such as the CA19-9 levels before chemoradiotherapy, clinical stage, grade of TRG and expression changes of LGR5 mRNA were significant prognostic factor for OS. CA19-9 levels before chemoradiotherapy and expression changes of LGR5 mRNA showed significant differences in multivariate analysis. CONSLUSION: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy caused changes in the expression of LGR5 mRNA. Our study shows that LGR5 mRNA expression changes before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and levels before chemoradiotherapy had the prognostic potential on the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.

METHODS: The expression of XRCC1 and ERCC1 in 59 ESCC tissues and 23 adjacent tissues were examined using SP immunohistochemocal stainig and were analyzed according to the clinic pathologic features and follow-up data. RESULTS: XRCC1 and ERCC1 protein were expressed in the nucleus of tumor cells in ESCC. There was no correlation in them. The positive expression rate of XRCC1 proteinin ESCC tissues and adjacent tissues were 52.5% and 13.0%, respectively (P=0.001). The positive expression rate of ERCC1 proteinin ESCC tissues and adjacent tissues were 48.3% and 20.0%, respectively (P=0.022).

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	This study aimed to clarify the role of multidrug resistance-associated protein 3 (MRP3) in resistance to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and long-term prognosis of advanced rectal cancer. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure MRP3 expression in biopsy specimens of 144 stage II-III rectal cancer patients who received preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The effect of MRP3 expression on short-term pathological response and postoperative long-term prognosis were assessed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Short interfering RNAs targeting MRP3 were synthesized and used to transfect human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. The effect of MRP3 down-regulation on cell proliferation and apoptosis in response to 5-fluorouracil and/or irradiation were examined in vitro and in xenograft mouse models, respectively. The content of intracellular reactive oxygen species and the activity of caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in response to irradiation were further evaluated. High expression (immunoreactive score > 6) of MRP3 significantly predicted poor pathological response to chemoradiotherapy (tumor regression grade ≤ 2 vs. ≥3, p = 0.002) in univariate analysis and unfavorable long-term prognosis (5-year overall survival: HR = 1.612, 95% CI, 1.094-2.375, p = 0.016; 5-year disease-free survival: HR = 1.513, 95% CI, 1.041-2.200, p = 0.030) in multivariate Cox analysis. MRP3 down-regulation significantly increased 5-fluorouracil or irradiation-induced cell apoptosis and attenuated tumor growth following irradiation in animal models. MRP3 inhibition significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species exporting from cells following irradiation, and increased expression of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase and caspase-3. Aberrant expression of MRP3 in rectal cancer confers chemo-radioresistance. MRP3 might be a predictive factor and an attractive target in treating advanced rectal cancer.

After the first biopsy, the patients underwent long-course preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy (a total dose of 45-50.4 Gy of irradiation to the pelvic region in 25-28 fractions over a period of 5 weeks). Six to 8 weeks after neoadjuvant radiotherapy, the patients received radical surgery (low anterior resection, LAR or abdominoperineal resection, APR) following the principle of total mesorectal excision The patients were then treated with the standard FOLFOX4 therapeutic regimen (bolus plus continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus leucovorin and oxaliplatin) for 6 to 8 cycles after surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Mechanism of radioresistance in rectal carcinoma remains largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 (ABCC4) in locally advanced rectal carcinoma and explore possible molecular mechanisms by which ABCC4 confers the resistance to neoadjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: The expression of ABCC4 and P53 mutant in biopsy tissue specimens from 121 locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients was examined using immunohistochemistry. The factors contributing to 3-year overall survival and disease-free survival were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Lentivirus-mediated small hairpin RNA was applied to inhibit ABCC4 expression in colorectal carcinoma cell line RKO, and investigate the radiosensitivity in xenograft model. Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate concentration and cell cycle distribution following irradiation were detected. RESULTS: High expression of ABCC4 and p53 mutant in pretreated tumors, poor pathological response, and high final tumor staging were significant factors independently predicted an unfavorable prognosis of locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients after neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Down-regulation of ABCC4 expression significantly enhanced irradiation-induced suppression of tumor growth in xenograft model. Furthermore, down-regulation of ABCC4 expression enhanced intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate production and noticeable deficiency of G1-S phase checkpoint in cell cycle following irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that ABCC4 serves as a novel predictive biomarker that is responsible for the radioresistance and predicts a poor prognosis for locally advanced rectal carcinoma after neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to verify the effect of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 on radiosensitivity of locally advanced rectal carcinoma. SETTING: The expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 protein in 121 pretreatment tissue samples from locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients was detected by immunohistochemistry. DESIGN: Pathological response to radiotherapy was evaluated according to tumor regression grading by postoperative histological examinations after they received long-course preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and the association between clinicopathological data and tumor regression grading was analyzed retrospectively. For further validation, short hairpin RNA was constructed and transfected into colorectal carcinoma cell line HT29. The knockdown efficiency was confirmed at both RNA and protein levels. The altered radiosensitivity was evaluated by methylthiazolyl tetrazolium assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and Hoechst 33258 staining. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression (p < 0.001), P53 type (p = 0.069), and CEA (p = 0.100) were possibly associated with tumor regression grading, and multivariate analysis demonstrated that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression (p < 0.001) and P53 type (p = 0.039) were positively correlated with response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients. Lentiviral vector was successfully introduced into HT29 cells and inhibited ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression efficiently and persistently. Downregulation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 expression significantly enhanced inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased colony formation capacity, and increased cell apoptosis induced by irradiation, as examined by a series of experiments in vitro. In addition, radiobiological parameters calculated according to the single-hit multitarget model were also decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 4 may be a useful molecular marker in predicting radiosensitivity, and a potential target in improving the response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy in locally advanced rectal carcinoma patients.

All patients underwent radical surgical tumor resection. Patients with upper thoracic esophageal malignancies were subjected to transthoracic esophagectomy with three‑field lymphadenectomy and patients with middle/lower thoracic ESCC underwent two-field lymphadenectomy. Following surgery, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy consisted of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with 49.2 Gy (range, 40-50 Gy) concurrent with two adjuvant cycles of cisplatin (25 mg/㎡; days 1‑3) and fluorouracil (600 mg/㎡; days 1-3) chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	p53 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3A (LC3A) are regulators of apoptosis and autophagy and are expressed at high levels in a number of human tumors. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of p53 and LC3A expression levels in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs). p53 and LC3A expression levels were measured by immunohistochemistry in 114 patients with stage II/III (Tany N+M0 or T3,4 Nany M0) ESCCs treated with surgery followed by adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The overexpression of p53 and LC3A was observed in 57 and 54% of ESCC samples, respectively. p53 staining was nuclear and LC3A was localized to the cytoplasm of tumor cells. p53 overexpression was more frequently observed in ESCCs with positive lymph nodes (P=0.017). Patients with ESCCs overexpressing p53 and LC3A were associated with a lower 5‑year overall survival rate than those with low p53 and LC3A expression (18.0 vs. 54.4%; P=0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the overexpression of p53 or LC3A was not associated with poor patient outcome (P>0.05). However, patients with high levels of p53 and LC3A co-expression had poor clinical prognoses (P=0.027). Thus, p53 and LC3A co-expression is an independent prognostic marker for patients with ESCC.

Tumors classified as 0 or 1+ were considered negative, and those classified as 2+ or 3+ were considered positive. Any discrepancies were resolved with a multihead microscope.	All patients underwent external beam radiotherapy using a 6-MeV high-energy linear accelerator. The initial treatment volume included the primary tumor and enlarged lymph nodes. Two-dimensional or three-dimensional treatment plans using CT scans were performed. The median radiation dose of 42.9 Gy (36 to 70 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week) was delivered with a 3- or 4-field technique. Two to five weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, restaging and surgery was performed. Each patient underwent esophagectomy and systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Biomarker identification is crucial for the selection of patients who might benefit from radiotherapy. To explore potential markers for response and prognosis in patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery, we evaluated the expression of cell cycle checkpoint-related proteins Chk2, Cdc25C, and Cyclin D1. A total of 56 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. Pretreatment tumor biopsy specimens were analyzed for Chk2, Cdc25C, and Cyclin D1 expression by immunohistochemistry. High expression of Chk2, Cyclin D1, and Cdc25C was observed in 44 (78.6%), 15 (26.8%), and 27 (48.2%) patients, respectively. The median survival was 16 months (range, 3-154 months), with a 5-year overall survival rate of 19.6%. Overexpression of Chk2 was associated with smoking (P = 0.021), overexpression of Cdc25C was associated with patient age (P = 0.033) and tumor length (P = 0.001), and overexpression of Cdc25C was associated with pathologic complete response (P = 0.038). Univariate analysis demonstrated that overexpression of Cdc25C and pathologic complete response was associated with better survival. In multivariate analysis, Cdc25C was the most significant independent predictor of better survival (P = 0.014) for patients treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. Overexpression of Cdc25C was significantly associated with pathologic complete response and better survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with radiotherapy followed by surgery. These results suggest that Cdc25C may be a biomarker of treatment response and good prognosis for esophageal carcinoma patients. Thus, immunohistochemical staining of Cdc25C in a pretreatment specimen may be a useful method of identifying optimal treatment for patients with esophageal carcinoma.

METHODS: The expression of HIF-1α and survivin in 50 patients with ESCC who received radiotherapy was detected by immunohistochemical SP method. The relationhsip between protein expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: The positive rates of HIF-1α and survivin protein expression were 68% and 72%, respectively. There was a positive relationship between then (γ=0.623, P<0.001). The expression of HIF-1α and survivin were closely relatyed with clinical stage and sitant metastasis. The expression of HIF-1α correlated with lymph node metastasis. The expressions of HIF-1α and survivin did not correlate with the degree of differentiation and the length of the primary tumor (P>0.05). The complete effective rate and mean survival period after radiotherapy were 8.8% and 10 months and 81.3% and 25 months in HIF-1α positive and HIF-1α negative group, respectively (P=0.000). The 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rates were 38.2%, 6.0%, and 2.9%, and 81.3%, 54.2%, and 7.9% in HIF-1α positive and HIF-1α negative group, respectively (P=0.001). CONCLUSION: HIF-1α and survivin were overexpressed in ESCC. The expression of HIF-1α protein positively correlates with the exprssion of survivin protein. The expression of HIF-1α has a close relationship with radiotherapy resistance of ESCC.	Tumor	Stage II: 9 patients, Stage III: 33 patients, Stage IV: 8 patients.

METHODS: The protein expression of HIF-1α and Tiam1 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 33 esophageal carcinoma specimens and 15 normal esophageal mucosal specimens. RESULTS: The positive rates of HIF-1α and Tiam1 protein expression in esophageal carcinoma were signifi cantly higher than those in normal esophageal mucosa (66.7% vs 6.7%, 72.7% vs 6.7%, both P < 0.05). High expression of HIF-1α was positively correlated with N stage (P < 0.05), while high expression of Tiam1 was positively correlated with TNM stage and N stage (both P < 0.05). The expression of HIF-1α and Tiam1 did not correlate with age, gender, tumor length or T stage. The complete effective rate and mean survival period after radiotherapy were significantly lower in HIF-1α-positive patients than in HIF-1α-negative ones (9.1% vs 63.6%, 9 months vs 25 months, both P < 0.05). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates were also significantly lower in the HIF-1α-positive group than in the HIF-1α negative group (40.9% vs 90.9%, 13.6% vs 54.5%, 6.8% vs 36.4%), and log-rank test suggested that the difference was signifi cant (P = 0.007). The expression of HIF-1α protein was signifi cantly correlated with that of Tiam1 protein in esophageal carcinoma (r = 0.433, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: High expression of HIF-1α and Tiam1 proteins is associated with lymph node metastasis in patients with esophageal carcinoma. Overexpression of HIF-1α may be linked to resistance to radiotherapy in patients with esophageal carcinoma and may affect the efficacy of radiotherapy.

Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ki67) is considered to be an objective indicator which could reliable and comprehensive response to cell population proliferation; vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was positively correlated with tumor angiogenesis. The aim of this study is to investigate the significance of the expression of CAIX in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues by analyzing the correlation between CAIX and clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer and VEGF, Ki67 expressions. Methods CAIX, VEGF and Ki67 protein were detected in 76 cases of NSCLC and 10 cases of lung inflammatory pseudotumor by immunohistochemistry. Results CAIX was expressed in 45 of 64 cases of NSCLC and not expressed in benign lesion pulmonary tissues. VEGF was expressed in 55 of 76 cases and Ki67 was expressed in 30 of 76 cases. The expression of CAIX in squamous cell carcinoma (SC) was higher than that in adenocarcinoma (AC)(69.7% vs 27.9%, P=0.001). In 34 cases who received radiotherapy, the objective response rates of CAIX positive and negative groups were 27.8% and 62.5% respectively; the expression of CAIX was positively correlated with VEGF (r=0.231, P=0.043) and was not correlated with Ki67 (r=0.064, P=0.583). Conclusion Compared with benign lesion pulmonary tissue, the expression of CAIX in NSCLC tissues is significantly increased and is positively correlated with VEGF. The expression of CAIX was also correlated with the objective response rate of radiotherapy, which provided new evidence about that hypoxia can increase NSCLC radiotherapy resistance.

The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis, and the logrank test was used for analyzing the survival difference between negative and positive samples.The Cox model was used for multivariate prognostic analysis.Results The follow-up rate was 87.2% ; 140 patients were followed up for at least 1 year, 136 patients for at least 2 years,and 129 patients for at least 3 years.XRCC3 was mainly expressed in the nucleus,and HOGG1 was mainly expressed in the nucleus and mitochondria,with a coincidence degree of 72.5% (x2 =23.94,P =0.000). The patients with positive XRCC3 expression and negative XRCC3 expression had similar short-term responses (x2 =0.98,P =0.614)as well as similar survival rates, and both patient groups had a median survival time of 54 months (x2 =0.17,P =0.683). The patients with positive HOGG1 expression and negative HOGG1 expression had similar short-term responses (x2 =0.26,P =0.880) as well as similar survival rates, and both patient groups had a median survival time of 49 months (x2 =0.08,P =0.780). The multivariate prognostic analysis showed that the response evaluation and tumor length were related to the prognosis of ESCC (x2 =7.99, P =0.005 ; x2 =3.76, P =0.045).Conclusions The protein expression of XRCC3 and HOGG1 may be unrelated to the prognosis of ESCC after radiotherapy.

Results Positive expression rate of MACC1was 68.5% in the NPC and MACC1 expression was associated with advanced T stages, lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stages of NPC (P < 0.05). The results of Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the five year overall survival rate in patients with positive expressions of MACC1 (45.9%) was significantly lower than that of those with negative expressions (73.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), Cox multifactor analysis results showed that MACC1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for NPC (P=0.004).

446	Impact of PARP-1 and DNA-PK expression on survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme	English	2011	21775006	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21775006	Journal Article	\N	34	18	16	\N	\N	[19.0,70.0)	Immunohistochemistry	According to median values of PARP1 and PRKDC, patients were divided into subgroups ≥ median (equal and more than median) and < median (less than median).	Treatment planning was performed using CT/MRI scans and TPS XiO CMS treatment planning system. The gross tumor volume (GTV) encompassed the resection cavity and any residual tumor. A 2-3 cm margin was added to create clinical target volume (CTV). Critical tissues were spared (brainstem, chiasma). For planned target volume (PTV), 0.5 cm margin was included. Treatments were performed using linear accelerators (30-60 Gy in 2.0 Gy fractions; mean dose 54 Gy). The prescribed dose was normalized to 100% at the isocenter and PTV was covered by 95% isodose surface (ICRU Report 50). None of the patients received concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (available since 2010). However, for recurrent disease, 24 patients received chemotherapy with lomustine (CCNU).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To analyze, whether higher tumor levels of DNA repair enzymes contribute to worse treatment results of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients after postoperative radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty four patients with GBM received postoperative radiotherapy. Tumor sections were examined for poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and DNA protein kinase (DNA-PK) expression. Immunohistochemical staining intensities of PARP-1 and DNA-PK were determined (score 0-3) and expression levels were correlated with patients overall survival. RESULTS: Median survival time of the whole study group was 10.0 months (95% CI 8.1-11.9). Median survival of patients with high and low (≥median and <median) tumor PARP-1 levels were 10.0 months (95% CI 7.9-12.1) and 12.0 months (95% CI 8.3-15.7), respectively (p=0.93). In contrast, median survival of patients with high and low tumor DNA-PK levels were 9.0 months (95% CI 7.2-10.8) and 13.0 months (95% CI 10.7-15.3), respectively (p=0.02). In multivariate analysis, DNA-PK expression emerged as a significant independent predictor for overall survival (HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.5-10.7, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: This hypothesis generating study showed that high tumor levels of DNA-PK correlate with poor survival of GBM patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these results and to clarify whether DNA-PK inhibitors might have a potential to radiosensitize GBM and improve the treatment outcome of this devastating disease.

447	Association of TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms with survival in bladder cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy	English	2009	19764997	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19764997	Journal Article	Japanese	96	74	22	69	\N	[29.0,89.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Specimens were considered to be positive for TP53 overexpression when more than 20% of nuclei were positively stained.	All patients received combined platinum-based systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. One cycle comprised cisplatin (70 mg⁄㎡ ) on day 1, with radiation at 1.8 gray (Gy) per fraction from day 2 to day 5 in the ﬁrst week and on 5 consecutive days in the second week. Three cycles of chemotherapy (CRT) were performed where possible; the treatment was halted in patients who received one or two cycles of therapy and showed persistent side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or pancyto- penia for 2 weeks, or who refused to continue with CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as bladder conservation therapy has shown promising results for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, CRT might diminish survival as a result of the delay in cystectomy for some patients with non-responding bladder tumors. Because the p53 tumor suppression pathway, including its MDM2 counterpart, is important in chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-associated effects, functional polymorphisms in the TP53 and MDM2 genes could influence the response to treatment and the prognosis following CRT. We investigated associations between two such polymorphisms, and p53 overexpression, and response or survival in bladder cancer patients treated with CRT. The study group comprised 96 patients who underwent CRT for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TP53 (codon 72, arginine > proline) and MDM2 (SNP309, T > G) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, and nuclear expression levels of p53 were examined using immunohistochemistry. None of the genotypes or p53 overexpression was significantly associated with response to CRT. However, patients with MDM2 T / G + G / G genotypes had improved cancer-specific survival rates after CRT (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, the MDM2 T / G + G / G genotypes, and more than two of total variant alleles in TP53 and MDM2, were independently associated with improved cancer-specific survival (P = 0.031 and P = 0.015, respectively). In addition, MDM2 genotypes were significantly associated with cystectomy-free survival (P = 0.030). These results suggest that the TP53 and MDM2 genotypes might be useful prognostic factors following CRT in bladder cancer, helping patient selection for bladder conservation therapy.

448	ERCC1 expression and tumor regression predict survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients receiving combined trimodality therapy	English	2014	25042384	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042384	Journal Article	\N	44	26	18	58.5	\N	[36.0,74.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The staining intensity was graded adjusted to the internal positive control as follows: 0 point, no staining; 1 point, weak intensity; 2 points, moderate intensity; and 3 points, strong intensity. The percentage of positive cells was rated as follows: 0 point, less than 10% positive cells; 1 point, 11-25% positive cells; 2 points, 26-50% positive cells; and 3 points, 51-100% positive cells. Points for staining intensity and percentage of positive cells were added, and the specimens were classified into two groups according to their overall score: negative expression for 0-1 point and positive expression for 2-6 points.	Neoadjuvant treatment consisted of two cycles of cisplatin 25 mg/㎡ infusion on days 1-3, 5-FU 500 mg/㎡/day as a continuous infusion over 24 h on days 1-5, and a total radiation dose of 40 Gy delivered at 2.0 Gy/day, 5 days per week. Radiation therapy was delivered with megavoltage equipment (>6 MV) using a multiple field technique. Two-field lymphadenectomy was performed 4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiation if patients without new evidence of stage M1 or inoperable T4 disease following a repeat CT scan. The surgical procedure was determined by the tumor location and surgeon’s preference.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Combined trimodality therapy with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery has shown promising results for locally advanced operable esophageal cancer. DNA repair proteins may affect treatment efficacy through repairing DNA damage induced by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We evaluated the associations of XRCC1, ERCC1 and MGMT expression with histopathologic response and survival in patients with locally advanced operable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) who received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded pre-treatment tissue samples, collected by endoscopic biopsy from patients treated with cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery, were immunohistochemically stained for XRCC1, ERCC1 and MGMT expression. RESULTS: Of the 44 patients, major histopathologic response was noted in 26 (59.1%) patients. 68.8% of patients with ERCC1-negative tumors had major histopathologic response, compared to 53.6% of those who expressed positive ERCC1, though the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.361). The patients with ERCC1-negative tumor presented much better overall survival than those positive for ERCC1 expression (P=0.018). Patients with major histopathologic response had a 3-year survival rate of 96.2% versus those with minor response, with a 3-year survival rate of 41.5% (P=0.000). Multivariate analysis showed that ERCC1 expression and histopathologic response were independent predictive factors of overall survival in patients with locally advanced operable ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation. CONCLUSION: Patients with ERCC1-negative tumors show a benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiation, ERCC1 expression and tumor regression are useful predictive markers in patients with locally advanced operable ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery.

449	VEGF as a predictor for response to definitive chemoradiotherapy and COX-2 as a prognosticator for survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2011	21468258	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21468258	Journal Article	\N	44	43	1	64	\N	[47.0,77.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For the assessment of EGFR, the immunoreactivity of EGFR was graded into four groups according to the intensity of cell membrane EGFR staining: high (markedly stronger staining than normal esophageal epithelium), medium (moderately stronger staining), low (the same staining level as normal epithelium), and negative (fainter staining). Strong and moderate staining groups were defined as positive for EGFR expression For the evaluation of VEGFA expression, when intensive positive staining of VEGFA was observed in more than 10% of the tumor cells, the case was considered VEGFA-positive. For PTGS2, the intensity of staining was determined as 0 (negative), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). A combined score based on the staining intensity and the percentage of stained cells was used as the final score. Low expression was defined as an intensity of 2 or 3 and < 10% stained cells or an intensity of 0 or 1 and < 50% stained cells. High expression was defined as an intensity of 2 or 3 and > 10% stained cells or intensity 1 and > 50% stained cells.	Radiotherapy was performed using a LINAC 6- or 10-MV X-ray unit, in daily 1.8 or 2 Gy with five fractions per week. The radiation dose ranged from 40 to 68.4 Gy with a median of 54 Gy. Initially anteroposterior and posteroanterior fields were used with a craniocaudal margin of 5 cm and a transverse margin of 2 cm adjacent to the gross tumor mass as determined by chest CT or esophagography. At doses between 36 and 40 Gy, a chest CT was performed for 3D-conformal radiotherapy planning and a boost dose was delivered to clinical target volumes with a craniocaudal margin of 3 cm and a transverse margin of 2 cm adjacent to the gross tumor volumes. Further radiotherapy boosts were administered to cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes depending on nodal size. To patients with adequate bone marrow function, as well as hepatic, and renal function, concurrent chemotherapy was delivered with 5-fluorouracil based regimen. Cisplatinum (75 mg/㎡) was administered intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13, and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/㎡) was administered as a continuous infusion for the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 9, and 13; the first two cycles were delivered concurrently with radiotherapy. Thirty-one patients (70.5%) received cisplatinum + 5-fluorouracil with a median of three cycles (range 1-10) and 13 patients received cispatinum plus TS-1 of oral fluorouracil agent.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	We investigated the patterns of pretreatment expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by immunohistochemical staining and determined their correlation with treatment response and survival in 44 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). The definitive CCRT consisted of a median dose of 54 Gy (range: 40.0-68.4 Gy) and two cycles of concurrent administration of mostly 5-fluorouracil + cisplatinum. High expression of EGFR, VEGF, and COX-2 was found in 79.5%, 31.8%, and 38.6%, respectively. The Cox regression analysis for overall survival (OS) showed that both the treatment response and COX-2 expression were significant. The 3-yr OS rates of patients that achieved a complete response and those that did not were 46.7% and 5.3%, respectively (P = 0.006). The logistic regression analysis for treatment response with various parameters showed that only a high expression of VEGF was significantly associated with a complete response. Unlike other well-known studies, higher expression of VEGF was significantly correlated with a complete response to CCRT in this study. However, higher expression of COX-2 was significantly associated with shorter survival. These results suggest that VEGF might be a predictive factor for treatment response and COX-2 a prognostic factor for OS in patients with ESCC after definitive CCRT.

The scores for the intensity of staining (I) were classiﬁed as follows: 0 no staining; 1 weak staining; 2 moderate staining; and 3 strong staining. The combined staining scores (S) were designated as P x I for each section. The immunohistochemical staining of PTPN13 was conducted in the cytoplasm, with a staining score of 0-2 considered negative and a score of 3-12 considered positive. The immunohistochemical staining of NFKB1 was conducted in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm using NFKB1 RELA, with staining scores of 0-3 being considered negative and nuclear staining or staining scores of 4-12 being considered positive. The immunohistochemical staining for TP53 was also evaluated semi-quantitatively according to the presence or absence of nuclear staining. Staining of TP53 was considered positive if >10% of malignant cells showed nuclear staining.	Chemotherapy protocols were based on 5-ﬂuorouracil, platinum, or taxane, combined with or without other anticancer agents. Radiotherapy was carried out as external, intracavitary, or interstitial irradiation, or a combination of these irradiations. The average irradiation dose was 65.1 Gy (range 38-91 Gy).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and p53 as markers for chemo-radio sensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). FAP-1 plays a role as an anti-apoptotic factor through Fas-dependent apoptosis after chemo-radiotherapy. NF-κB and p53 might be involved in modulation of FAP-1 expression. FAP-1, NF-κB and p53 expression were immunohistochemically examined using biopsy specimens in 50 OSCC patients treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. FAP-1 was expressed in 52%, NF-κB in 52% and p53 in 46% of patients. There was no significant difference in FAP-1, p53 or NF-κB expression according to the clinicopathological features. No correlation was found among FAP-1, p53 or NF-κB expression. FAP-1-positive cases showed a poorer survival rate than FAP-1-negative cases (P = 0.0409) and NF-κB-positive cases showed a poorer survival rate than NF-κB-negative cases (P = 0.0018). Multivariate analysis showed that FAP-1 expression, NF-κB expression, clinical stage and age were significant independent variables for survival (clinical stage: P = 0.0016; age: P = 0.0016; NF-κB: P = 0.0314; FAP-1: P = 0.0366). These results suggest that FAP-1 and NF-κB might play a role as chemo-radioresistant factor during chemo-radiotherapy, and FAP-1 and NF-κB expression in OSCC would be feasible markers for chemo-radio sensitivity and prognosis.

450	Clinical significance of HIF-1alpha expression in patients with esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy	English	2011	21737664	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21737664	Journal Article	\N	25	24	1	62	\N	[45.0,78.0)	Immunohistochemistry	For HIF1A, each sample was assigned to one of the following categories: (I) low (0-10% positivity); (II) high (11-100% positivity).	External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was administered with megavoltage equipment of photon energies of 4 MeV or more. The total doses of EBRT ranged from 40 to 66.6 Gy with a single fraction of 1.8-2 Gy administered 5 days per week. The median total dose of all 25 patients was 66.6 Gy, and 22 of 25 patients (88.0%) were treated with a total doses of 60 Gy or more. The treatment field of EBRT consisted of localized field in 4 patients (16%), and the primary tumor plus regional lymph nodes in the remaining 21 patients (84%). In most patients, computed tomography (CT)-based treatment planning and conformal radiotherapy were used. Anterior-posterior opposed fields were used up to 32.4-40 Gy, and a booster dose of 14-34.2 Gy was given, using bilateral oblique or multiple fields. The clinical target volume for the primary tumor was defined as the gross tumor volume plus 3 cm craniocaudally. The planning target volumes for the primary tumor and the metastatic lymph nodes were determined with 1- to 1.5-cm margins to compensate for setup variations and internal organ motion. Lung heterogeneity corrections were not used. Chemotherapy was administered concurrently with radiotherapy. One course of chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin (80 mg/㎡ on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/㎡ on days 2-6), with 3-4 week intervals to a total of 1-2 courses. All patients received antiemetics with granisetron and metoclopramide before chemotherapy administration.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIM: We investigated whether hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1 α) expression in pretreatment biopsies of esophageal cancer is predictive of clinical outcome in patients with esophageal cancer undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 25 patients were reviewed. Radiotherapy was administered to total doses of 40-66.6 Gy (median: 66.6 Gy) with a single fraction of 1.8-2 Gy. Cisplatin (80 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/m2 on days 2-6) were administered concurrently with radiotherapy, every 3-4 weeks to a total of 1-2 courses. Tissue samples from esophageal cancer were obtained from all 25 patients by biopsy before concurrent CRT, and semiquantitative analyses of HIF-1α expression were performed using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: High HIF-1α expression was observed in 11 out of 25 patients (42.7%), and HIF-1α expression was significantly correlated with initial response to CRT (p=0.0027). Patients with high HIF-1α expression had significantly poorer local control (LC) (5-year LC: 42.7%) than those with low expression (5-year LC: 72.5%; p=0.0322). Patients with high HIF-1α expression also had significantly lower recurrence-free survival (RFS) (5-year RFS: 18.2%) compared to those with low HIF-1α expression (5-year RFS: 39.8%; p=0.0009), and on multivariate analysis, HIF-1α (p=0.001) and number of chemotherapy courses (p=0.010) were independent prognostic factors for RFS. CONCLUSION: HIF-1α expression is significantly correlated with initial response to concurrent CRT, and is predictive of RFS for patients with esophageal cancer receiving concurrent CRT.

451	Epidermal growth factor receptor is a possible predictor of sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy in the primary lesion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2007	17940077	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17940077	Journal Article	\N	62	54	8	68	\N	[43.0,85.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The immunoreactivity of EGFR was graded into four groups according to the intensity of cell membrane EGFR staining in the whole tumor: high (markedly stronger staining than normal esophageal epithelium), medium (moderately stronger staining), low (the same staining level as normal epithelium), and negative (fainter staining). Strong and moderate staining groups were defined as positive for EGFR expression, in agreement with previous interpretations of EGFR in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. VEGFA staining was graded as follows: (a) +, staining intensity in cancer cells was stronger than that in stromal cells; (b) ±, staining intensity in cancer cells was equal to that in stromal cells; and (c) -, staining intensity in cancer cells was weaker than that in stromal cells. The cases graded as + were defined as positive, as described in previous reports.  The percentages of CCND1-positive tumor cells were calculated by counting the number of brown-stained tumor nuclei/total number of cancer cells in the most highly stained area on a high-power view (x400). Cut-off values were determined by the following estimation: CCND1-positive judgment was a more than 30% labeling index.  The PCNA index was the percentage of nuclei staining positive. A PCNA score greater than 40 was taken as PCNA-positive.	The treatment comprised protracted 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion (400 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 and 8-12), and a 2 h infusion of cisplatinum (CDDP 40 mg/㎡on days 1 and 8) combined with radiation therapy (2 Gy/day) delivered for 3 weeks (5 days/week). These schedules were repeated twice every 4-5 weeks and the total radiation dose was 60 Gy. For patients who showed an objective response to treatment, additional chemotherapy was administered and consisted of a protracted infusion of 5-FU (800 mg/㎡/day) on days 1-5 and a 2 h infusion of CDDP (80 mg/㎡/day) on day 1. This treatment was repeated every 4 weeks for two courses. No further treatment was administered if no disease progression was observed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is currently performed for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Some reports have revealed that patients who responded well to CRT had favorable outcomes, whereas poor responders conversely showed a worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers predicting sensitivity to CRT. METHODS: We reviewed 62 patients with T(3-4), N-any, and M-any esophageal SCC treated with definitive CRT. The regimen comprised protracted 5-fluorouracil infusion and a 2-h infusion of cisplatinum combined with radiation therapy (2 Gy/day) at a total radiation dose of 60 Gy. The expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor, cyclin D1, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were investigated immunohistochemically in biopsy specimens obtained before treatment from all 62 patients. The immunoreactivities were compared with responsiveness to CRT, as evaluated by endoscopy. RESULTS: The complete response rate of the primary tumor estimated by endoscopy was 62% (13/21) in patients in the EGFR-positive group. The difference in the CR rate between EGFR-positive and -negative groups was significant (p = 0.037). The immunoreactivities of the other molecular markers did not show a significant correlation with the responsiveness of the primary lesion to CRT. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that positive immunostaining for EGFR was significantly correlated with primary CR for CRT in esophageal SCC. CONCLUSION: Among 62 patients with esophageal SCC, differences in the responsiveness of primary lesions to CRT were correlated with EGFR immunoreactivity assessed in the biopsy specimens. These results suggest that EGFR may help to predict the response of primary sites to definitive CRT in esophageal SCC, although the results should be confirmed in a larger, more homogeneous series.

The intensity of NFKB1 nuclear staining was evaluated on a three-point semiquantitative scale as follows: 0, no staining; 1, weak to moderate; 2, strong staining. The extent of cancer cells with positive NFKB1 was expressed as the fraction of labeled cells (i.e., staining levels 1 and 2) in the cancer fields. Cases showing labeling index of ≥5% were regarded as positive for the purpose of the analysis.	Induction chemotherapy was administered to 53 patients. Of these, 42 were enrolled in a clinical trial combining docetaxel, irinotecan, and 5-fluorouracil, 8 patients were treated in a platinol-based induction therapy trial, and 3 patients were treated with a taxane-based combination. If there was no cancer progression observed, patients received a second cycle of induction chemotherapy. Patients received up to 50.4 Gy of radiotherapy in 28 fractions. The baseline chemotherapy for all patients was 5-fluorouracil but all patients received additional drugs; most commonly, a platinol, taxane, or camptothecin. Concurrent chemotherapy combination was given for 5 weeks (Monday-Friday) of the first 5 radiation weeks. Five to 6 weeks after the completion of chemoradiation, a complete restaging was done. Patients proceeded to surgery if they had no distant metastatic cancer and were physiologically fit. A transthoracic (Ivor-Lewis or total three-field) or transhiatal approach was used, including mediastinal and celiac lymphadenectomy in all cases.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Transcriptional factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) seems to be associated with aggressive clinical biology (chemoradiation resistance and metastatic progression) of esophageal cancer. We hypothesized that activated NF-kappaB would define clinical biology irrespective of the type of chemotherapy or sequence administered. METHODS: Pretherapy and/or posttherapy cancer specimens were examined for activated NF-kappaB and correlated with pathologic response to chemoradiation, metastatic potential, overall survival, disease-free survival, and type of chemotherapy or sequence used. FINDINGS: Eighty patients undergoing chemotherapy and concurrent radiation were studied. Activated NF-kappaB prior to any therapy was associated with the lack of complete pathologic response (pathCR, P = 0.006). Forty-five (78%) of 58 patients achieving <pathCR had activated NF-kappaB in pretherapy and/or posttherapy cancer specimens versus 2 (9%) of 22 patients with pathCR (P = 0.001). Twenty-four (51%) of 47 patients with activated NF-kappaB in cancer developed metastases versus 7 (21%) of 22 patients with negative NF-kappaB in cancer (P = 0.01). At a median follow-up of 32 months, 25 (53%) of 47 patients with activated NF-kappaB cancer had died versus 3 (9%) of 33 patients with negative NF-kappaB cancer. NF-kappaB activation was the only independent predictor of disease-free survival (P = 0.01) and overall survival (P = 0.007) in a multivariate model. The class of chemotherapy or its sequence had no effect on NF-kappaB expression or patient outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are the first to show that pretreatment-activated NF-kappaB significantly correlates with clinical biology of esophageal cancer, and most importantly, with pathCR. To therapeutically exploit NF-kappaB-regulated genes and their pathways, further research is warranted.

However, no correlation between the COX2 expression and resistance to chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma has been characterized. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether COX2 expression is an indicator of resistance to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the feasibility of COX2 as a biomarker for CRT. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients who were diagnosed with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma from biopsy samples were enrolled in the present series. All patients underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting, followed by radical esophagectomy. COX2 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining and statistically compared with the histopathologic findings in surgically resected specimens. RESULTS: The rate of responders was 87% for weak expression of COX2, 62% for moderate expression, and 30% for strong expression, and there was a close correlation between COX2 expression and the response rate (Kendall's τb = 0.396, P = 0.001). In the univariate analysis, negative or weak expression of COX2 was found to correlate significantly with CRT response (odds ratio, 6.296; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.58-25.096; P = 0.010). In the multivariate analysis, weak expression of COX2 (30% or less) was found to be an independent prognostic factor (odds ratio, 6.534; 95% CI, 1.535-27.803; P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: The COX2 expression predicts resistance to chemoradiotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and it also is a feasible biomarker for evaluating the CRT response.

457	Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 is associated with chemoradiotherapy resistance and prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients	English	2008	18459994	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18459994	Journal Article	\N	112	98	14	\N	56.6000000000000014	[37.0,76.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Definitive CRT group: The total radiation dose was 60 Gy, applied in 2 Gy fractions delivered 5 days/week for 6 weeks to the mediastinum and neck. In the same period, chemotherapy was performed intravenously using cisplatin (20 mg/㎡/day on days 1-5 and 22-26) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg/㎡/day by continuous infusion on days 1-3 and 22-24). CRT + S group: The total radiation dose was 40 Gy, applied in 2-Gy fractions delivered 5 days/week for 4 weeks to the mediastinum. Chemotherapy regimen was the same as for the definitive CRT group. Esophagectomy with two-field lymph node dissection was carried out approximately 4 weeks after completion of CRT in those patients without disease progression.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Our objective was to investigate whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression can predict the patient's response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and ensuing prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The clinicopathological and follow-up data of 112 patients with ESCC who underwent CRT from January 2001 to June 2006 were analyzed retrospectively. The immunohistochemical expression level of COX-2 was examined for all biopsy specimens of primary tumors, and the correlation of COX-2 expression with the patient's response to CRT and prognosis was examined. COX-2 positive immunostaining was detected in 111 (99.1%) of the patients, including overexpression in 54 (48.2%) patients and low expression in 58 (51.8%) of the patients. The response of tumors with a low level expression of COX-2 (70.7%, 41/58) was significantly higher than that of tumors with COX-2 overexpression (42.6%, 23/54; P = 0.003). Patients with a low level of COX-2 expression had a higher downstaged rate than those with a high level of COX-2 expression (9/13 vs 2/8), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). In the definitive CRT group (91 cases), COX-2 overexpression was significantly associated with poor 3-year overall survival (P = 0.028). Multivariate analysis showed that only metastatic stage (nonregional node metastasis) was an independent prognosis factor. The assessment of COX-2 status may provide additional information to identify ESCC patients with poor chances of response to CRT and potential candidates for more individualized treatment.

The regimen of preoperative HCRT consists of irradiation given five days per week, and two fractions of hyperthermia per week, combined with chemotherapy. Hyperthermia was clinically applied using this radiofrequency system with an endotract electrode (Endoradiotherm 100A, Olympus Co, Tokyo, Japan), and 30 mg/㎡of cisplatin was administered three times during the treatment periods (for a total of 90 mg/㎡), along with 30 Gy of irradiation (2 Gy/day, 5 days per week.)	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The p53 and p21 genes are closely related to sensitivity to chemoradiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expressions of the p53 and p21 genes were immunohistochemically examined in 32 patients with esophageal cancer, who underwent an esophagectomy after hyperthermochemoradiotherapy (HCRT). The significance of the expression of these genes for the effect of HCRT was evaluated. RESULTS: HCRT was markedly effective (grade 3 response: no residual viable cancer cells) in 12 cases (38%). The incidences of the grade 3 were 67% and 20% in the cases with a positive and negative p21 expression, respectively (p=0.0213). A multivariate analysis revealed the p21 expression to be a significant independent factor associated with the histological effects. None of the 10 patients with p53-positive and p21-negative tumors showed a grade 3 response, while 55% showed grade 3 response in other combination groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combination of p53 and p21 expressions in biopsy findings can thus predict the histological effectiveness of HCRT.

EGFR: immunostaining by the antibody was considered positive if at least 1% of cells exhibited membrane labeling which was expressed as either weak (1—30%), moderate (31—69%) or strong (70—100%).	Treatment consisted of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT): radiation therapy was delivered over a ﬁve-week period, and chemotherapy was with 5FU (1000 mg/㎡ per day as a continuous infusion from Day 1 to Day 4) and cisplatin (75 mg/㎡ on Day 1). The CRT was delivered either preoperatively (Group 1) or as the only treatment (Group 2) using the ‘Herskovic protocol’ [fractionated radiation therapy (2 Gy/fr) in 25 fractions for ﬁve weeks, associated with four chemotherapy protocols delivered on Weeks 1, 5, 8 and 11). Patients given preoperative CRT (group 1) received an average of 47 Gy (range 36—60) while those in group 2 received an average of 51 Gy (range 22—66).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify factors predictive of a complete endoscopic/histopathological response to chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal cancer. PATIENTS: Clinical and histopathological factors (Ki67, p53 and EGFR expression) were studied in 56 patients presenting with esophageal cancer between September 2000 and March 2006 (35 squamous cell carcinomas, 20 adenocarcinomas, one undifferentiated carcinoma). The response to chemoradiotherapy was evaluated endoscopically and by histological examination in 16 patients who underwent surgical resection. RESULTS: Independent factors predictive of a complete endoscopic response were good performance status (RR=15.75; CI: 1.74-142.58; P=0.01) and overexpression of Ki67 (RR=4.46; CI: 1.08-18.31; P=0.04). In patients who underwent surgery, a major histopathological response was associated with complete endoscopic response (P<0.01), complete CT-scan response (P=0.04) and good performance status (WHO=0) (P=0.04). The mean survival was 40 months. Adenocarcinoma histology (RR=3.18, CI: 1.13-8.54; P=0.02) and an impaired performance status (RR=4.79; CI: 1.07-21.41; P=0.04) were independently associated with poor survival. CONCLUSION: In the present study, good performance status and overexpression of Ki67 were two independent factors for complete endoscopic response after chemoradiotherapy for esophageal cancer. Independent risk factors for poor survival were adenocarcinoma histological type and impaired performance status. Further prospective studies are necessary to complete the present results.

A speciﬁc nuclear staining in less than 1% of neoplastic cells was deﬁned as NFKB1-negative.	Radiotherapy was administered according to standard procedure and dosing: Virtual Simulation was used with spiral CT three-dimensional (3D) image acquisition (Tomoscan AV, Philips), 3D contouring of Gross Tumour Volume (GTV), Clinical Target Volume (CTV) (including tumour, positive nodes, mesorectum, presacral, obturatory and internal iliac nodes), Planning Target Volume (PTV) and organ-at-risk (OAR) according to ICRU 50 Report criteria. 3D dose rendering was obtained on a treatment planning system (Pinnacle, ADAC) to deliver to PTV at least 95% of the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy to the isocenter, with a 1.8 Gy per daily fraction, 5 fractions per week. Concomitant chemotherapy was a ﬂuoropyrimidine-based regimen. Surgery was planned 4-6 weeks after the completion of chemo-radiotherapy. Resected samples were histologically analysed in order to deﬁne the pathological tumour and nodal stage and the Tumour Regression Grade (TRG) evaluated by Mandard’s score. The follow up schedule was performed according to Institutional Practice and National Guidelines. The disease assessments included laboratory tests including tumour markers every 3 months, chest + abdomen + pelvis CT scan (or MRI) every 3-6 months and colonoscopy every year.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND:\nNF-κB expression has been shown to be responsible for resistance to antineoplastic agents.\n\nAIMS: The aim of our study was to investigate the importance of NF-κB expression as prognostic factor in locally advanced rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the immunoreactivity for NF-κB in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant treatment (chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy) in our Institution between March 2003 and June 2006. RESULTS: Seventy-four consecutive patients were enrolled into this study. Immunohistochemistry analysis for NF-κB was performed both in biopsies and in primary tumour samples. NF-κB was considered positive when at least 1% of the tumour cells showed nuclear positivity. A significant correlation between a positive NF-κB nuclear expression, both in biopsies and in tumour samples, and a worse overall survival was observed. Moreover, median time to progression was significantly shorter in the NF-κB-positive subgroup of patients. CONCLUSION: Globally, our findings seem to suggest that NF-κB could represent an important parameter able to predict the outcome in patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment for rectal cancer. It also could be useful in order to select patients to receive adjuvant chemotherapy, intensifying the adjuvant therapy and, in the next future, obviating the use of drugs involving NF-κB system in their mechanism of action in NF-κB-positive patients.

Methods A total of 95 patients with advanced rectal cancer and received radiation therapy between January 2000 and January 2009. MRP4 and P53 protein expression in the paraffin-embedded specimen were detected by immunohistochemistry.Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with the sensitivity of rectal cancer to radiation. Results Forty patients(42％) were sensitive to radiation therapy, of whom 10(11％) achieved pathological complete remission. Fifty-five patients were (58％) not responsive to radiation. Patients with low expression of MRP4 had a 66.7％(24/36) response rate, significantly higher than that of patients with high MRP4 expression (29.1％,16/59)(P＜0.05). Patients with low expression of P53 had a 63.9％(23/36) response rate, significantly higher than that of patients with high P53 expression (28.8％,17/59)(P＜0.01). The response rate after long course radiation therapy was 83.3％(20/24), significantly higher than that of patients who underwent short and medium course radiation [(31.3％ ,5/16) and (27.3％, 15/55)] (P＜0.01). Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed radiation regimen, the expression of P53 and MRP4 protein were independently associated with the sensitivity of rectal cancer to radiation (P＜0.05). Conclusion MRP4 may serve as a predictive marker for the sensitivity of rectal cancer to preoperative radiation.	Chinese Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery	T3-4: 95 patients.
463	Prognostic significance of changes of tumor epidermal growth factor receptor expression afterneoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma	English	2012	22847519	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22847519	Journal Article	\N	53	38	15	63	\N	[41.0,75.0)	Immunohistochemistry	A score of 1+ in EGFR staining indicated faint membrane staining in more than 1% of tumor cells in part of the cell membrane. A score of 2+ denoted moderate complete membrane staining in over 1% of tumor cells. A score of 3+ indicated a strong staining in over 1% of tumor cells.	Neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisted of external beam radiation with concomitant continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil 200 mg/㎡/day in continuous infusion, during radiation that was interrupted during the weekends. Patients treated with IMRT technique, brachytherapy boost, or potentiation with capecitabine were not included in the present analysis. All patients received pelvic radiotherapy using either a four-field box technique (anterior to posterior, posterior to anterior and two laterals) or a three field technique (posterior to anterior and two laterals) with megavoltage photon beams (6 or 15 MV) from a linear accelerator (Varian, Clinac 600 or Clinac 2100, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA). A conventional two-dimensional simulator (Varian, Ximatron, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to design each radiation field. A total dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions (single dose 1.8 Gy) was administered to the intersection of the fields. The boost volume was treated to a dose of 5.4 Gy in three fractions (single dose 1.8 Gy). Surgery was performed 4-6 weeks after the end of chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiation on tumor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression in patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 53 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (clinical stages II and III) were studied. Neoadjuvant treatment consisted of 50.4 Gy/28 fractions external radiation with concomitant continuous 5-fluorouracil. Surgical resection was performed 4-6 weeks after the chemoradiation. EGFR expression in the pretreatment biopsies and in the resected specimens was assessed with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Patients with an increase of EGFR expression during chemoradiation had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS; p = 0.003) and overall survival (OS; p = 0.005) compared to patients with either no change or decrease in EGFR expression. The 5-year DFS in patients with increased EGFR expression was only 29% compared to 61% in patients without an increase of EGFR expression. Similarly, the 5-year OS of the patients with increased EGFR expression was 29% compared to 66% in patients without an increase of EGFR expression. All recurrences in patients who had an increase of EGFR expression occurred within the first 2 years after the treatment. The increase in EGFR expression was the only significant predictor of DFS (p = 0.007) and OS (p = 0.04) using multivariate Cox regression analysis. CONCLUSION: An increase of EGFR expression during chemoradiation may be associated with significantly shorter DFS and OS. The increase of EGFR could identify a population of patients in whom the effect of the treatment with anti-EGFR therapy should be studied.

Radiotherapy was administered during the pauses between chemotherapy cycles, alternating with chemotherapy, and consisted of 2 Gy daily fractions up to 70 Gy. Radiotherapy was not given on the days when cytotoxic treatment was delivered. Radiotherapy employed the standard 3 shrinking field technique (6 MV photons) with shielding blocks drawn on simulator films to protect critical organs.2 After a cumulative dose of 40 Gy, medulla was excluded from irradiation and high-energy (8-10 MeV) electron beams were used to treat the posterior regions of the neck.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin-based regimens is curative in a subset of patients with locally advanced (stage III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the head and neck (LAHNSCC), but causes considerable toxicity. To seek predictive biomarkers, we analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 and MDM2 genes in LAHNSCC patients treated with cisplatin-based CRT. We analysed germ-line p53 72 Arg/Pro (R/P) and MDM2 309 SNPs and somatic p53 mutational status in 140 LAHNSCC and determined their utility as predictive biomarkers. In cases with wild-type p53, overall survival (OS) was longest in 72RR (median OS=60.8 months) and less favourable in 72PP (median OS=6.7 months, p<0.0001). OS in individuals with 72RP was intermediate between 72RR and 72PP, while in patients with missense p53 mutations, median OS did not reach statistical significance. Median OS was significantly shorter in patients with MDM2 309 SNP genotypes GG or GT, compared to TT (15 vs. 86 months; p<0.0001). The predictive effect of the G allele was maintained independent of age, gender, stage, primary site, nodal status, performance status, EGFR grade, HPV status, p53 mutation and p53 SNP (HR for death 3.241; 95% CI 1.90-5.52, p<0.001). The predictive utility of the MDM2 germ-line 309 SNP, which can be easily determined from peripheral blood, implies that it may be of value in the objective selection of patients for radical CRT. In contrast, the predictive utility of the 72 Arg/Pro SNP in p53 requires mutational analysis of p53, limiting its routine clinical use.	Oral Oncology	Stage II: 17 patients, Stage III: 123 patients.

Initial irradiation fields (to 50-50.4 Gy) had superior and inferior margins of 5 cm beyond primary gross tumor volume. Lateral, anterior, and posterior margins were ≥ 2 cm. Regional lymph nodes were included. For definitive treatment, a boost of 9-10 Gy was delivered to the primary tumor with 2-cm margins and enlarged lymph nodes with margins ≥ 1 cm. Two chemotherapy courses were administered concurrently with radiotherapy. 5-FU was administered as continuous infusion of 1,000 mg/㎡/day for 120 h (days 1-5) every 4 weeks. Cisplatin was administered as intravenous bolus of 75-80 mg/㎡ on day 1. Surgery for tumors of the upper and middle third was radical en bloc resection of the esophagus and two-field lymphadenectomy. For tumors of the lower third, transhiatal esophagectomy was performed. Esophageal continuity was restored by gastric tube.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is negatively associated with clinical outcome. The prognostic value of VEGF receptor 1 (FLT1) is unclear. This retrospective study investigated the impact of tumor expression of VEGF and FLT1 on outcome in 68 stage III esophageal cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The impact of tumor VEGF and FLT expression (< or =10% vs. > 10%) and five additional potential prognostic factors on overaLL survival (OS) and Locoregional control (LC) was retrospectively evaluated. These factors included T-stage (T3 vs. T4), N-stage (NO vs. N1), treatment (radiochemotherapy plus resection vs. radiochemotherapy alone), erythropoietin (ERYPO 10000, Janssen-Cilag, Neuss, Germany) administration during radiotherapy, and majority of hemoglobin levels during radiotherapy (<12 vs. > or =12 g/dl). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients receiving resection (R0 vs. R1/2 resection). The factors found to be significant on univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test) were included in multivariate analyses performed with the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, improved OS was associated with T3 stage (p = 0.011), surgery (p = 0.019), and hemoglobin > or =12 g/dl (p < 0.001). Improved LC was associated with T3 stage (p = 0.025), hemoglobin > or =12 g/dl (p < 0.001), and VEGF negativity (p = 0.045). On multivariate analyses, only hemoglobin maintained significance. In patients having surgery, RO resection was significantly better than R1/2 resection for OS (p < 0.001) and LC (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preradiotherapy tumor VEGF expression appears negatively correlated with outcomes, whereas FLT1 expression appears to have no significant impact on OS and LC.

Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: Hypoxia has been established as a key factor influencing the pathophysiology of malignant growth. Hypoxia-induced changes in gene expression are coordinated primarily by hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and HIF-2α. The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not HIF-2α expression is associated with survival and response to radiation in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS: After reviewing the medical records of 119 patients treated in our institution by primary therapy for stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer, we performed a case-control study. Cases (n=12) were selected from patients with local recurrence or radiation failure after primary radiation therapy with or without concurrent chemoradiation. For each case, we selected two controls from patients who had no evidence of local recurrence. Using pre-treatment paraffin-embedded tissues, we evaluated the expression of HIF-2α by immunohistochemistry. Staining was scored based on intensity (intensity score [IS], 0-3) and proportion (proportion score [PS], 0-100). The results were analyzed by the Student t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher's exact test, and Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic expression of HIF-2α, representing the degree of hypoxia, had a relationship with poor response to radiotherapy. The hazard ratio of recurrence was 1.71 for the HIF-2α IS (p=0.110) and 1.04 for the HIF-2α PS (p<0.001), indicating that the HIF-2α staining area correlates weakly with the risk for recurrence. CONCLUSION: The HIF-2α expression area may have an important role in radioresistance in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. We conclude that a wider area of hypoxia predicts an increased probability of radioresistance.	Journal of Gynecologic Oncology	Stage IIB: 20 patients, Stage IIIB: 13 patients, Stage IVA: 3 patients.
467	Expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activated EGFR predict poor response to (chemo)radiation and survival in cervical cancer	English	2009	19920104	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19920104	Journal Article	\N	375	\N	375	54	\N	[21.0,92.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Tumors were considered positive for EGFR in case of ≥10% membranous staining. phosphorylated AKT1 and phosphorylated MAPK1 stainings were considered as positive if >10% of tumor cells showed positive (2+) cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining. Positive staining of PTEN was defined as >10% cytoplasmic staining. Positive phosphorylated EGFR staining was defined as at least weak positive (1+) cytoplasmic staining, as the activated EGFR is internalized. 	Radiotherapy included external beam radiotherapy up to 45 Gy and low-dose rate brachytherapy, two applications of 17.5 Gy. Concurrent chemotherapy before 1999 consisted of three cycles of carboplatin and 5-fluorouracil. Carboplatin dose was 300 mg/㎡ , dissolved in 250 mL 5% glucose, given over 30 min i.v. on day 1. 5-Fluorouracil dose was 600 mg/㎡ , dissolved in 2 L of saline and administered i.v. continuously on days 2 to 5. This cycle was repeated another two times every 28 d. After 1999, chemotherapy consisted of 40 mg/㎡ cisplatin i.v. once a week for 6 wk concomitant with external pelvic and intracavitary radiation.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway has been reported to induce resistance to (chemo)radiation in cancers, such as head and neck cancer, whereas EGFR-targeted agents in combination with (chemo)radiation seem to improve treatment efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between proteins involved in the EGFR pathway and response to (chemo)radiation and survival in a large, well-documented series of cervical cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Pretreatment tissue samples of 375 consecutive International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage Ib to IVa cervical cancer patients treated with (chemo)radiation between January 1980 and December 2006 were collected. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were prospectively obtained during standard treatment and follow-up. Protein expression of EGFR, phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), PTEN, phosphorylated AKT, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. RESULTS: EGFR staining was present in 35.3%, pEGFR in 19.7%, PTEN in 34.1%, phosphorylated AKT in 4.1%, and pERK in 29.2% of tumors. pEGFR staining was related to PTEN (P = 0.001) and pERK staining (P = 0.004). EGFR staining was inversely related to PTEN (P = 0.011). In multivariate analysis, membranous staining of EGFR [hazard ratio (HR), 1.84; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.20-2.82; P = 0.005] and cytoplasmic staining of pEGFR (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.66; P = 0.016) were independent predictors of poor response to (chemo)radiation. Membranous EGFR staining also was an independent prognostic factor for poor disease-specific survival (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09-2.17; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR and pEGFR immunostainings are frequently observed and independently associated with poor response to therapy and disease-specific survival in cervical cancer patients primarily treated by (chemo)radiation. Our data present the EGFR pathway as a promising therapeutic target in already ongoing clinical trials.

468	A study on expression of S100A9 and NMP238 in squamous carcinoma tissues of the cervix with different radiotherapy sensitivity	Chinese	2007	\N	http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&id=lczlxzz200709002	Journal Article	\N	95	\N	95	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate significance and expression of S100A9 and NMP238 in squamous carcinoma tissues of the cervix with difference radiotherapy sensitivity. METHODS: The fresh squamous carcinoma tissues of the cervix were collected from 10 untreatred cervical carcinoma patients and preserved in the -80 ℃ refrigeratory. The tissues were classified into two groups: high sensitivity group (HS) and low sensitivity group (LS) according to their response to radiotherapy. Protein separating was performed by using tw-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), then the differentiallty expressed protein-spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry and data searching in the Mascot-database. Two differentially expression protein were assayed by western blot and immunohistochemical method. RESULT: The gels were clear and successfully analyzed. It was found high expression of S100A9 in HS group, and high expression of nuclear matrix protein 238 were found in LS group. The higher expression S100A9 in HS group and the higher expression of N,P238 in LS group were confirmed by western blot. Immunohistochemical result showed that S100A9 positivity rate (88.3%, 53/60) in HS group was significantly higher than that (28.6, 10/35) in LS group (χ2=35.34, P<0.0001); NMP238 positivity rate (85.7%, 30/35) in LS group was significantly higher than that (85.7%, 30/35) in HS group (χ2=35.34, P<0.0001). S100A9 expression was significantly stronger in HS group than in LS group and NMP238 expression was significantlystronger in LS group than in HS group. CONSLUSION: S100A9 and NMP238 expression are associated with radiotherapy sensitivity of cervical squamous carcinoma.	Chinese Clinical Oncology	Stage I-IIA: 95 patients.

METHODS: The expression of NM23H1 and vessel endothelium growth factor (VEGF) protein were examined by immunohistochemistry SP staining in 108 NPC tissues, the expression of NM23H1 and VEGF protein in NPC tissues with clinical stage of NPC, radiosensitivity of tumor, survival rate of patients, relapse and metastasis of carcinoma wer studies. RESULTS: The positive rate of NM23H1 and VEGF was 48.1% and 59.3, respectivel. The clinical staging, metastatic potential of lymph nodes were correlated with low-level expression of NM23H1 expression. The clinical staging, metastatic potential and poor sensitivity of radiotherapy were correlated with high level expression of VEGF protein. The patients with positive VEGF expression had worse prognosis than those with negatiove VEGF expression. The expreeison of NM23H1 protein was negatively correlated with the expression of VEGF protein (r=-0.577, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The low level expression of NM23H1 protein and the high level expression of VEGF protein may be associated with the development and poor prognosis of NPC.

470	Biopsy specimen microvessel density is a useful prognostic marker in patients with T(2-4)M(0) esophageal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy	English	2002	11801548	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11801548	Journal Article	\N	73	60	13	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	\N	Chemotherapy consisted of a protracted infusion of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/day) on days 1-5 and 8-12, combined with CDDP (40 mg/㎡/day) with adequate hydration and antiemetic coverage on days 1 and 8. This schedule was repeated twice every 5 weeks. Radiation therapy using megavoltage X-rays was started on day 1 concomitantly with chemotherapy. There was a 2-week break after a dose of 30 Gy. Radiation therapy was restarted on day 36, along with the same chemotherapy schedule used before. For patients who showed an objective response to treatment, additional chemotherapy was administered and consisted of a protracted infusion of 5-FU (800 mg/㎡/day) on days 1-5 and a 2-h infusion of CDDP (80 mg/㎡/day) on day 1. This treatment was repeated every 4 weeks for two courses. Additional courses of chemotherapy were optional but limited to a total of four courses. No further treatment was administered if no disease progression was observed.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic markers for chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in T(2-4)M(0) esophageal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated clinicopathological and biological markers in biopsy specimens from 73 T(2-4)M(0) esophageal cancer patients treated with CRT (5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin and 60 Gy of radiation). Expressions of p53 gene product, Ki-67 labeling index, epidermal growth factor receptor, cyclin D1, vascular endothelial growth factor, microvessel density (MVD), thymidylate synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and glutathione S-transferase pi in formalin-fixed biopsy samples of primary tumors before CRT were examined immunohistochemically. Clinicopathological and biological marker expressions were compared in terms of survival. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that performance status and T stage in clinicopathological features had a significant association with survival (P = 0.007 and 0.04, respectively) and that patients whose tumors showed high MVD [>median (19.7 vessels)] in biological markers had significantly better survival than those with low MVD (< or = median, P = 0.02). Also, there were weak associations of p53 and Ki-67 with survival (P = 0.08 and 0.07, respectively). Multivariate analysis, using both clinicopathological and biological markers, showed that MVD, T stage, and performance status became independent variables (P = 0.002, 0.02, and 0.02, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients with high MVD tumors survived longer than those with low MVD tumors (median survival time, not reached and 13 months, respectively; 3-year survival rate, 61% and 33%, respectively), with a significant difference of P = 0.02. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that MVD using pretreatment biopsy specimens is a potentially useful prognostic marker for CRT in patients with T(2-4)M(0) esophageal cancer who are treated with CRT.

471	The correlation and prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation and MGMT protein in glioblastomas	English	2009	19834398	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19834398	Journal Article	\N	83	39	44	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The immunoreactivity of the MGMT protein was evaluated semiquantitatively by estimating the fraction of positive cells, and a level of less than 5% was regarded as negative (group 1), less than 50% as moderate degree (group 2), and 50% or more as high degree (group 3). When we compared the correlation between MGMT promoter methylation and protein expression, the immunoreactivity was divided into 2 groups: immunonegative (group 1) and immunopositive (groups 2 and 3). Only nuclear staining was considered for grading.	These patients underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy (60 Gy) and temozolomide (Temodal; Schering-Plough, Kenilworth, NJ) chemotherapy. Thirty-six of the 83 patients received concomitant-adjuvant Temodal chemotherapy, and 47 patients underwent “recurrent” Temodal chemotherapy (i.e., chemotherapy given at the time of recurrence of the tumor). Concomitant-adjuvant Temodal chemotherapy was administered at a dose of 75 mg/㎡/d during radiotherapy and then 150 mg/㎡/5 d for 4 weeks, followed by 200 mg/㎡/5 d for 4 weeks for a total of 6 cycles. Patients undergoing recurrent Temodal chemotherapy received a dose of 200 mg/㎡/5 d for 4 weeks after recurrence. Twenty-eight patients received additional therapy owing to recurrence after the above treatment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation and prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation and protein expression in patients with glioblastoma. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with glioblastoma underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy between October 2000 and June 2008. To investigate the correlation between MGMT methylation and MGMT expression, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) and immunohistochemical staining was performed. To analyze the correlation between MGMT methylation and MGMT expression according to location, biopsies were obtained from 37 different sites within the tumors in 12 patients. Age, sex, Karnofsky Performance Scale status, extent of removal, chemotherapeutic methods, and MGMT promoter methylation and protein expression were analyzed as prognostic factors. RESULTS: The total median survival was 15.8 months (range, 12.6-19.1 months). The results of MSP were the same at various sites in 12 patients. A correlation between MSP and immunohistochemical staining was observed in 50% of the patients. In 73 patients, negative MGMT expression was detected in 70.5% of 44 patients with MGMT promoter methylation, and positive expression was observed in 55.2% of the 29 patients with unmethylated promoters. Multivariate analysis revealed that the extent of removal (P = 0.001) and the combination of MGMT promoter methylation and negative MGMT expression (median survival, 20.06 months; P = 0.006) were significantly associated with longer survival. CONCLUSION: We report the feasibility of using MSP combined with immunohistochemical staining as a prognostic factor. The results of the present study suggest that MGMT promoter methylation in combination with negative MGMT expression might be a good prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma.	Nurosurgery	\N
477	Correlation among six biologic factors (p53, p21(WAF1), MIB-1, EGFR, HER2, and Bcl-2) and clinical outcomes after curative chemoradiation therapy in squamous cell cervical cancer	English	2009	19101092	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19101092	Journal Article	\N	57	\N	57	61	\N	[27.0,82.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The level of expression was assessed semiquantitatively using the immunoreactive scoring (IRS) system. The IRS value was determined by considering the intensity, graded on a scale of 0-3 (0 = no staining, 1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining, and 3 = strong staining) and extent (percentage of positive tumor cells) of staining. The extent of staining was graded on a scale of 0-4 (0 = no staining; 1 = 1-25% staining, 2 = 26-50% staining, 3 = 51-75% staining, and 4 = 76-100% staining). An IRS value (range, 0-7) was obtained by adding the two parameters. The cutoff level of expression of the biochemical markers was deﬁned as a dichotomous variable of low expression (IRS value 0-5) or high (IRS 6-7) in p53, p21, MIB-1, and Bcl-2; low (0-4) or high (5-7) in EGFR; and low (0-3) or high (4-7) in HER2, respectively.	Patients were treated with a combination of conventional pelvic external beam cCRT (concurrent chemoradiation therapy) and high-dose-rate intracavitary cCRT. The details of the treatment protocol have been previously reported. External beam cCRT energy was 10 MV. A four-ﬁeld irradiation technique was used to spare the small intestine. Treatment position was supine. Simulation was by computed tomography (CT) simulator. The standard treatment protocol of our institution consists of the following: whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) of 19.8 Gy in 11 fractions (Fr) plus WPRT with a midline block (MB) of 30.6 Gy in 17 Fr for all Stage IIA and Stage IIB without a bulky mass ($4cm); WPRT of 30.6 Gy in 17 Fr plus WPRT with MB of 19.8 Gy in 11 Fr for Stage IIB with a bulky mass all Stage IIIA and Stage IIIB without a bulky mass; and WPRT of 39.6 Gy in 18 Fr plus WPRT with MB of 10.8 Gy in 6 Fr for Stage IIIB with a bulky mass and Stage IVA. Patients treated postoperatively were excluded. In addition to central shielding cCRT, these patients also underwent intracavitary cCRT. Theintracavitary cCRT was performed with Ir-192 sources with four insertions (one or two weekly), at fraction doses of 6.0 Gy at Point A. Concurrent chemotherapy was combined with cCRT in all patients. All patients received cisplatinalone (75 mg/㎡ in a bolus infusion on Days 1, 22, and 43).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The expressions of six cell-cycle-associated proteins were analyzed in cervical squamous cell carcinomas in correlation in a search for prognostic correlations in tumors treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The expressions of p53, p21/waf1/cip1, molecular immunology borstel-1 (MIB-1), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2), and Bcl-2 were studied using an immunohistochemical method in 57 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma treated with cCRT. Patients received cCRT between 1998 and 2005. The mean patient age was 61 years (range, 27-82 years). The number of patients with Stage II, III, and IVA disease was 18, 29, and 10, respectively. RESULTS: The number of patients with tumors positive for p53, p21/waf1/cip1, MIB-1, EGFR, HER2, and Bcl-2 was 26, 24, 49, 26, 13, and 11, respectively; no significant correlation was noted. The 5-year overall survival rates of HER2-positive and -negative patients was 76% vs. 44%, which was of borderline significance (p = 0.0675). No significant correlation was noted between overall survival and expressions of p53, p21/waf1/cip1, MIB-1, EGFR, and Bcl-2. No correlation was observed between local control and expression of any of the proteins. CONCLUSION: Expression of HER2 protein had a weak impact of borderline significance on overall survival in squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix treated with cCRT. However, no clinical associations could be established for p53, p21/waf1/cip1, MIB-1, EGFR, and Bcl-2 protein expressions.

Systemic adjuvant treatment was administered to all but three patients, who refused it. The treatment consisted of tamoxifen (n = 59), toremifen (n = 3) or chemotherapy (n = 64). The chemotherapeutic regimens used were: adriamycin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide in 13 cases; cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in 16 cases; and adriamycin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-FU in 28 cases. The following treatment combinations were given to single patients: cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-FU, vincristine and prednisone; adriamycin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide/docetaxel or paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide; and docetaxel or paclitaxel and adriamycin or epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-FU. 5-FU, adriamycin or epirubicin and cyclophosphamide was given to four patients. All patients underwent radiotherapy. In 46 of these patients radiotherapy was local only, whereas in the other 35 patients the ipsilateral subclavian region, the infraclavicular chest wall and level III of the axilla were also irradiated. A monocentric four-field technique was used to cover the locoregional target volume. The median total dose was 50.4 Gy for the lymphatics. Irradiation of the chest wall or breast was performed using single doses of 1.8 or 2 Gy, which summed to a total dose of 48.6-64.8 Gy (median, 50.4 Gy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (hif-1alpha) furnishes tumor cells with the means of adapting to stress parameters like tumor hypoxia and promotes critical steps in tumor progression and aggressiveness. We investigated the role of hif-1alpha expression in patients with node-positive breast cancer. METHODS: Tumor samples from 77 patients were available for immunohistochemistry. The impact of hif-1alpha immunoreactivity on survival endpoints was determined by univariate and multivariate analyses, and correlations to clinicopathological characteristics were determined by cross-tabulations. RESULTS: hif-1alpha was expressed in 56% (n = 43/77) of the patients. Its expression correlated with progesterone receptor negativity (P = 0.002). The Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significantly shorter distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P = 0.04, log-rank) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.04, log-rank) in patients with increased hif-1alpha expression. The difference in overall survival (OS) did not attain statistical significance (5-year OS, 66% without hif-1alpha expression and 55% with hif-1alpha expression; P = 0.21). The multivariate analysis failed to reveal an independent prognostic value for hif-1alpha expression in the whole patient group. The only significant parameter for all endpoints was the T stage (T3/T4 versus T1/T2: DMFS, relative risk = 3.16, P = 0.01; DFS, relative risk = 2.57, P = 0.03; OS, relative risk = 3.03, P = 0.03). Restricting the univariate and multivariate analyses to T1/T2 tumors, hif-1alpha expression was a significant parameter for DFS and DMFS. CONCLUSIONS: hif-1alpha is expressed in the majority of patients with node-positive breast cancer. It can serve as a prognostic marker for an unfavorable outcome in those with T1/T2 tumors and positive axillary lymph nodes.	Breast Cancer Research	T1-2: 55 patients, T3-4: 22 patients.

METHOD: The expression of COX-2 protein was examined in 30 radiosensitive and 30 radioresistant poorly differentiated NPC by immunohistochemical staining (SP method) before radiotherapy. The relation between the expression of COX-2 and the effect of radiotherapy was analyzed. RESULT: The positive rate of COX-2 protein expression was 61. 67% in NPC tissues, there was statistical difference( P <0. 01) of the positive rate between the 86. 67 % of 30 radioresistant and 36. 67 % of radiosensitive NPC tissues. The intensity of COX-2 protein expressions showed statistical difference( P <0. 05),too. Based on the expression of COX-2, the effect of radiotherapy, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, false positive and false negative were predicted as follows: 86. 67Y, 63. 33% ,75. 00%, 70. 27% ,82. 61% ,36. 67% and 13. 33 , respectively. CONCLUSION: COX-2 expression may serve as a marker in predicting the response to radiotherapy in NPC. According to the expression of COX-2, the sound treatment scheme can be selected.

Treatment with curative intent consisted of external beam radiotherapy with a four-ﬁeld box technique to the pelvis and to the para-aortic region consisting of a total dose of 40-50 Gy (median 48.6 Gy) applied in daily fractions of 1.6-2 Gy. External beam irradiation was carried out using a 25 MV linear accelerator and with central shielding in anterior-posterior portals depending upon stage and tumour volume. Three to six fractions of intracavitary high dose-rate brachytherapy were applied in weekly fractions of 7 Gy each to point ‘A’, depending upon tumour stage and tumour volume	Radiotherapy	5	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in the regulation of tumour growth and metastasis. It was the aim of this study to examine the impact of serum VEGF levels on the likelihood of response to radiotherapy and on the disease-free survival in patients with cervical cancer. Blood was taken before commencing treatment and serum VEGF was assessed by quantitative ELISA in 23 patients with cervical cancer stage IB-IVA undergoing primary radiotherapy. Serum VEGF levels were correlated with clinical and histopathologic factors as well as with response to radiotherapy and time to progression. Nineteen of the 23 patients had a complete response and four patients had persistent disease at 3 months. The median follow-up was 25 months (95% confidence interval: 23.5-26.5 months). At the time of analysis, eight patients were tumour-free and 15 patients had tumour progression; 12 of these 15 patients died of disease. Overall, the median serum VEGF level was 244 pg/ml (range 31.9-817.6 pg/ml). All four patients with local failure had VEGF levels >244 pg/ml, whereas 11 of the 19 patients with complete response had serum VEGF of < or =244 pg/ml (P=0.035). The median time to progression was 5 months in patients with VEGF of >244 pg/ml compared to 19 months in patients with VEGF of < or = 244 pg/ml (log rank, P=0.003). In multivariate analysis, serum VEGF, tumour size and histological type, but not the patient's age, stage and grade of histological differentiation influenced the progression-free survival. Elevated pre-therapeutic serum VEGF levels are associated with poor response and a shorter time to progression in patients with cervical cancer undergoing primary radiotherapy.

Surgical intervention was performed 4-6 weeks after the radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	In this study, we evaluated the possible role of Growth Hormone Receptor (GHR) expression pattern in determining rectal cancer radiosensitivity. We examined GHR expression in pre-treatment biopsy materials and post-operative specimens from 98 patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). GHR expression was evaluated for association with tumour radiosensitivity, which was defined according to Rectal Cancer Regression Grade (RCRG). IHC results demonstrated that GHR overexpression was significantly associated with a poor response to radiotherapy (P < 0.001, r(s) = 0.399); RT-PCR detection of GHR expression on pre-radiation biopsy specimens also showed that GHR mRNA negative group had a higher radiation sensitivity (P < 0.001, r(s) = 0.398). Compared with the pre-radiation biopsy specimens, the paired post-operative specimens showed a significantly up-regulated GHR expression in the reliquus cancer cells (P < 0.001). In conclusion, GHR expression levels may be an indicator for rectal cancer radiosensitivity before pre-operative irradiation. The administration of GHR antagonist may have the potential to increase rectal cancer radiosensitivity.	European Journal of Cancer	Stage I: 25 patients, Stage II: 37 patients, Stage III: 36 patients.

Intensity of staining was scored using a 4-point scale with 0 indicating no expression, 1 indicating minimal staining, 2 indicating moderate staining, and 3 representing heavy staining. CD34 was scored as the average number of vessels per ﬁve high-powered ﬁelds (HPF) using a X 20 objective lens.

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine a variety of biomarkers in carcinoma of the cervix to better characterize (1). the natural history of the disease, (2). response to radiotherapy (RT), and (3). potential for new therapeutic strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with Stage IB-IVA carcinoma of the cervix, treated with definitive intent RT, and on whom tumor tissue blocks were available were included in this study. Charts were reviewed for clinical parameters and disease status. Immunohistochemistry was performed for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD34, topoisomerase II alpha (topo-II), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was performed with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as the end points. Biomarkers were evaluated for correlation between various prognostic factors. RESULTS: In this series of 55 patients with carcinoma of the cervix treated with definitive RT, only stage was significant on univariate analysis for DFS (p < 0.0001). On univariate analysis, increasing FIGO stage (p < 0.0001) and membranous staining of EGFR (p < 0.037) indicated diminished OS. On multivariate analysis for DFS, COX-2, VEGF, and stage were significant (p = 0.012, p = 0.014, and p = 0.03, respectively), with increased expression indicating a worse prognosis. For OS, multivariate analysis revealed that VEGF, EGFR, and FIGO stage were significant (p = 0.005, p = 0.011, and p < 0.0001, respectively). Significant direct correlations were identified between VEGF and CD34 (p = 0.04), COX-2 and topo-II (p = 0.04), COX-2 and grade (p = 0.04), and tumor size and clinical stage (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Multivariate analysis revealed that increased staining for VEGF and COX-2 indicated diminished DFS, and VEGF and EGFR identified patients at increased risk of death. A significant direct correlation between VEGF and CD34 implicates the process of angiogenesis. Topo-II is a proliferative marker and it correlated directly with COX-2, indicating that expression of COX-2 may be greater in more proliferative tumors. Increased expression of EGFR, VEGF, and COX-2 has identified patients with a worse prognosis in cancer of the cervix. These data support the investigation of therapeutics that target these proteins in carcinoma of the cervix.

478	Increased expression of pAKT is associated with radiation resistance in cervical cancer	English	2006	16721365	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16721365	Journal Article	\N	27	\N	27	\N	\N	[36.0,80.0)	Immunohistochemistry	The staining was scored on a scale from 0 to 3+ as follows: 0, no staining; 1+ , <50% with weak intensity; 2+, more than 50% with weak or moderate intensity; 3+ , more than 50% with strong intensity. For statistical analysis of survival curve, we classified the phosphorylated AKT1 (pAKT1) expression of score 0 or 1+ as pAKT1 negative, score 2+ or 3+ as pAKT1 positive.	All of these patients were given external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) as well as high-dose rate (HDR) intracavitary brachytherapy. The whole pelvis total dose was 5040 Gy with 1.8 Gy of daily fraction, administered five times a week. High-dose rate brachytherapy was started 4-5 weeks after the initiation of the EBRT. The dose of HDR brachytherapy was 24 Gy at point A, with 4 Gy per fraction twice a week for 3 weeks.	Radiotherapy	5	Phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) is a major contributor to radioresistance in human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of pAKT expression and radiation resistance in cervical cancer. A retrospective review was made of the records of 27 women who received primary radiation therapy due to locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) with FIGO stage IIB-IVA. Nine patients regarded as radiation resistant developed local recurrences with a median progression free interval of 9 months. Eighteen patients did not show local recurrences, and were regarded as a radiation-sensitive group. Using pretreatment paraffin-embedded tissues, we evaluated pAKT expression by immunohistochemistry. A significant association was found between the level of pAKT expression and local recurrence. Immunohistochemical staining for pAKT was significantly more frequent in the radiation-resistant than in the radiation-sensitive group (P=0.004). The mean progression-free survival was 86 months for patients with pAKT-negative staining (19 cases) and 44 months for patients with pAKT-positive expression (eight cases) (P=0.008). These results suggest that signalling from phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/pAKT can lead to radiation resistance, and that evaluation of pAKT may be a prognostic marker for response to radiotherapy in LACC.

479	Correlation between human epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4), phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt), and clinical outcomes after radiation therapy in carcinoma of the cervix	English	2005	16157365	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16157365	Journal Article	\N	55	\N	55	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Overexpression of EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB3, ERBB4, and phosphorylated AKT1 was defined as ≥7380, ≥2.0, ≥0.8, ≥2.4, and ≥3780 (intensity scale), respectively.	All patients were treated at a single radiation therapy center with standard external beam radiation techniques (with MV photon energies) and the brachytherapy component was delivered with low-dose rate brachytherapy for all patients included in the analysis.	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate prognostic significance of and correlations between HER1 (EGFR), HER2 (c-erb-B2), HER3 (c-erb-B3), HER4 (c-erb-B4), and phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) in patients treated with radiation for cervical carcinoma. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with stages I-IVA cervical carcinoma were treated with definitive radiotherapy. Tumor expression of each biomarker was quantitatively scored by an automated immunohistochemical imaging system. Parametric correlations were performed between biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as primary endpoints. RESULTS: Correlations were observed between expression of HER2 and HER4 (P = 0.003), and HER3 and HER4 (P = 0.004). Decreased HER2, HER4, and P-Akt expressions were significant for diminished DFS on univariate analysis (P = 0.04, P = 0.008, and P = 0.02, respectively). Increased EGFR, and diminished HER2, HER4, and P-Akt expression were significant or showed trends toward significance for diminished OS on univariate analysis (P = 0.07, P = 0.008, P = 0.09, and P = 0.08, respectively). After controlling for pretreatment factors, multivariate analysis revealed HER2 associated with improved OS (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These data emphasize that significant correlations exist between the differential expression of various HER family receptors. Multivariate analysis revealed only increased HER2 expression associated with improved OS after controlling for pretreatment clinical factors. These data emphasize the importance of continued basic and translational research on the HER family of receptors in cervical carcinoma.

480	Immunohistochemical detection of osteopontin in advanced head-and-neck cancer: prognostic role and correlation with oxygen electrode measurements, hypoxia-inducible-factor-1alpha-related markers, and hemoglobin levels	English	2006	17056190	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17056190	Journal Article	\N	34	29	5	59	\N	[37.0,84.0)	Immunohistochemistry	Staining was assessed from 5 to 10 high power ﬁelds at X 400 magniﬁcation dependent on the size of biopsies or surgical specimens of tumors. Expression was determined by assessing semiquantitatively the percentage of decorated tumor cells and the staining intensity. The percentage of positive cells was rated as follows: 1-10% positive cells (1+), 11-50% positive (2+); 51-80% positive (3+); and, >80% positive cells (4+). Staining intensity was scored as weak (1+), moderate (2+), and intensive (3+). Scores for expression and scores for percentage of positive cells were multiplied to calculate an immunoreactive score (IRS) ranging from 0 to 12. For statistical analysis, the cutoff level for grouping immunohistochemical protein expression was deﬁned at the median IRS score that was an IRS >0 for SPP1.	In 24 patients with inoperable tumors, radical radiotherapy was delivered using a hyperfractionated accelerated regimen with daily fractions of 2 Gy to a total dose 30 Gy followed by twice-daily fractions of 1.4 Gy up to a total dose of 70.6 Gy. This radiation regimen was combined with concomitant 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU)/ mitomycin C or cisplatinum/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Ten patients were treated with postoperative radiotherapy with daily fractions of 2 Gy up to a total dose of 64 Gy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The tumor-associated glycoprotein osteopontin (OPN) is discussed as a plasma marker of tumor hypoxia. However, the association of immunohistochemical OPN expression in tumor sections with tumor oxygenation parameters (HF5, median pO(2)), the hypoxia-related markers hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), or hemoglobin and systemic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels has not been investigated. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Tumor tissue sections of 34 patients with advanced head-and-neck cancer treated with radiotherapy were assessed by immunochemistry for the expression of OPN, HIF-1alpha, and CA IX. Relationship of OPN expression with tumor oxygenation parameters (HF5, median pO(2)), HIF-1alpha and CA IX expression, hemoglobin and serum VEGF level, and clinical parameters was studied. RESULTS: Bivariate analysis showed a significant correlation of positive OPN staining with low hemoglobin level (p = 0.02), high HIF-1alpha expression (p = 0.02), and high serum vascular endothelial growth factor level (p = 0.02) for advanced head-and-neck cancer. Furthermore, considering the 31 Stage IV patients, the median pO(2) correlated significantly with the OPN expression (p = 0.02). OPN expression alone had only a small impact on prognosis. However, in a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression model, the expression of either OPN or HIF-1alpha or CA IX was associated with a 4.1-fold increased risk of death (p = 0.02) compared with negativity of all three markers. CONCLUSION: Osteopontin expression detected immunohistochemically is associated with oxygenation parameters in advanced head-and-neck cancer. When the results of OPN, HIF-1alpha, and CA IX immunohistochemistry are combined into a hypoxic profile, a strong and statistically significant impact on overall survival is found.

481	Does vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) predict local relapse and survival in radiotherapy-treated node-negative breast cancer?	English	1999	10574263	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10574263	Journal Article	\N	302	\N	\N	56	\N	[29.0,74.0)	Immunohistochemistry	\N	All patients were treated with segmental resection with axillary dissection. In the group with T2 tumours (21-50 mm) (n = 66) no upper limit concerning the maximum size of the tumour was set for treatment with sector resection. Surgery was followed by radiotherapy delivered daily at 2-Gy fractions, 5 days per week to a total dose of 56 Gy. Radiotherapy was started within 4-6 weeks after surgery.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The aim of this study was to determine the association of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) content in 302 consecutive node-negative breast cancer (NNBC) patients treated with only locoregional radiotherapy to relapse free- (RFS) and overall survival (OS). VEGF content in tumour cytosols was measured by an enzymatic immunoassay for the major isoform VEGF165. The median age was 56 years, the median follow-up time 56 months. A wide range (0.01-144.79 pg microg(-1) DNA) of VEGF content was found (median 1.92). Significant associations were found between VEGF and oestrogen receptor (ER) content, progesterone receptor (PR) and tumour size (P = 0.005). Univariate analysis displayed significant reduced RFS and OS for patients with higher VEGF content (P = 0.0113 and P = 0.0075 respectively). A total of 43 recurrences have been found (ten local relapses within the breast, five in the axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes and 28 distant metastasis). There was no significant correlation between the localization of the relapse and the VEGF content. Multivariate analysis suggested VEGF as the only predictor of OS (relative risk (RR) = 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.97-13.37), and in patients with T1 tumours (n = 236) the multivariate analysis clearly displayed VEGF as the only independent predictor of both RFS and OS (RR = 5.1, CI = 1.07-24.59). In the subgroup with ER-positive tumours (n = 229), multivariate analysis showed VEGF as the only significant predictor of RFS and OS (RR = 10.44, CI = 1.26-86.38). The results suggest VEGF165 as a predictor of RFS and OS in NNBC patients treated with locoregional radiotherapy, comprising especially patients with favourable prognosis of T1 tumours, or ER-positive tumours. The high VEGF expression might define a radioresistant phenotype, or indicate an early distant spread which might require adjuvant systemic treatment.

482	Increased expression of ICAM-3 is associated with radiation resistance in cervical cancer	English	2005	15880373	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15880373	Journal Article	\N	29	\N	29	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The distribution and intensity of immunostaining were scored on a scale from 0 to +++, where 0 denotes no staining; +, less than 50%; ++, 50-90%; +++, more than 90%.	\N	Radiotherapy	5	To search for a marker that predicts the efficacy of radiation therapy in human cervical cancer, gene expression profiles between parental SiHa cervical cancer cells and radiation-resistant SiHa/R cells have been compared by the microarray technique. Microarray and Northern blot analyses demonstrated that the ICAM-3 expression was upregulated in SiHa/R cells. This increased expression of ICAM-3 in SiHa cells enhanced cell survival by about 34.3% after a 2 Gy dosage of radiation. In addition, SiHa/ICAM-3 cells showed a 2.45-fold higher level of FAK phosphorylation than that of the control cells. In tumor specimens, ICAM-3 staining was restricted to tumor stromal endothelial cells and lymphocytes. The overexpression of ICAM-3 was significantly more frequent in radiation-resistant cervical cancer specimens when compared with radiation-sensitive specimens (83.3% vs. 35.3%; p = 0.015). With these observations, we can suggest that an increased expression of ICAM-3 is associated with radiation resistance in cervical cancer cells and the expression of ICAM-3 can be used as a valuable biomarker to predict the radiation resistance in cervical cancer that occurs during radiotherapy.

Overexpression of ERBB2 and EGFR were defined as >2.0 and >8000 (intensity scale), respectively. In addition, ERBB2 and EGFR were manually scored for percent of positive cells (distribution): 0 = none, 1 ≤ 10%, 2 = 10-50%, 3 ≥ 50%; and for the intensity of staining with a subjective score of 0-3: 0 = no expression, 1 = minimal staining, 2 = moderate staining, 3 = heavy staining.	Fifty-five patients with stages I-IVA carcinoma of the cervix were treated with definitive radiation therapy.	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate HER2neu and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression with respect to overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS), and correlate expression with pretreatment factors. Comparative evaluations of manual and automated immunohistochemical imaging systems for HER2neu and EGFR expression were made. METHODS: Fifty-five patients with stages I-IVA carcinoma of the cervix were treated with definitive radiation therapy. Immunohistochemistry was performed for HER2neu and EGFR, and scored by both manual and automated methods. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) as primary endpoints, and biomarkers were evaluated for correlation between prognostic factors. RESULTS: Strong correlations in HER2neu and EGFR protein expression were observed between digitally and manually analyzed staining (P <== 0.0001). Increased FIGO stage and decreased HER2neu expression were significant for reduced DFS on univariate analysis (P <== 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively). Increased FIGO stage, decreased HER2neu expression, and increased membranous staining of EGFR were significant for diminished OS on univariate analysis (P <== 0.0001, P = 0.002, and P = 0.043, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed only increased membranous staining of EGFR associated with diminished DFS and OS (P = 0.046 and P = 0.012, respectively). Overexpression of HER2neu correlated significantly with adenocarcinoma, and overexpression of EGFR correlated significantly with squamous cell carcinoma histology (P = 0.038 and P = 0.035). Inverse correlations were observed between HER2neu expression and clinical stage, EGFR membranous staining, and EGFR distribution (P = 0.007, P = 0.006, and P = 0.034, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Increased expression of HER2neu and decreased EGFR membranous staining identified patients with improved DFS and OS on univariate analysis, although only decreased EGFR membranous staining was significant on multivariate analysis. We also found strong correlation of results between manually and automated imaging methods.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant treatment strategies have been developed to improve survival of patients with advanced rectal cancer. Since mainly patients with major histopathological response benefit from this therapy, predictive and prognostic markers are needed. We examined the association of β-catenin and Her2/neu protein expression with histopathologic response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and prognosis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS: Fifty-four patients (33 male; 21 female; median age 60.4 years) with locally advanced rectal cancer were included in this study. All patients received a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (50.4 Gy, 5-FU) followed by surgical resection. Histomorphologic regression was evaluated by Dworak and Cologne staging system. Major response was defined by Dworak classification when resected specimens contained less than 50% vital tumor cells (n = 14) and by Cologne grading system when resected specimens contained less than 10% vital tumor cells (n = 15). Intratumoral β-catenin (nuclear/membranous) and Her2/neu (cytoplasmatic/membranous) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-therapeutic specimens and correlated with clinicopathologic parameters. RESULTS: A significant association was detected between pre-therapeutic membranous β-catenin levels and response: patients with a lower β-catenin protein expression showed significantly more often a major response compared with patients having high intratumoral protein levels (p = 0.011). In addition, patients with a higher Her2/neu protein expression showed a significant survival benefit compared with patients having low intratumoral protein levels (5-year survival rate: 81% vs. low 41%; p = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: The pre-therapeutic β-catenin and Her2/neu protein expression seem to be valuable predictive and prognostic markers in the multimodality treatment of advanced rectal cancer.

Preoperative chemoradiotherapy was administered to all patients. the radiation therapy was administered using dual-photon linear accelerators at an energy level of 6-mV/10-mV. A total radiation dose of 45 Gy was given in 25 fractions delivered to the pelvis over a period of 5 weeks (1.8 Gy/day, 5 days/ week) and was followed by a 5.4-Gy boost targeting the primary tumor. the radiation field was defined as follows: the superior border was 1.5 cm above the sacral promontory (l5 level); the inferior border was the inferior margin of the obturator foramen or 3 cm below the lower margin of the tumor; the lateral border was 1.5 cm lateral from the bony pelvis; the anterior border was 3 cm anterior to the tumor; and the posterior border was 0.5 cm posterior to the sacral surface. the chemotherapy entailed 2 cycles of intravenous bolus injections of 5-fluorouracil (425 mg/㎡/day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡/day) administered for 5 days during the first and fifth weeks of radiation therapy. All patients underwent surgery 6 to 8 weeks following completion of the chemoradiotherapy. Curative resection was performed on all patients with no residual cancer. the surgical resection was classified as low anterior resection (LAR), ultra low anterior resection (uLAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: To investigate the association between nuclear β-catenin overexpression in rectal adenocarcinoma and radioresistance. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted. The analysis involved 136 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent short-course preoperative radiotherapy and radical resection. The expression of β-catenin in both pretreatment biopsy specimens and resected primary tumor tissues was examined by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of β-catenin expression with radioresistance was evaluated using the tumor regression grading (TRG) system. The relationship between β-catenin expression and clinicopathological characteristics was also analyzed. Univariate and logistic multivariate regression analyses were adopted to determine the independent factors of radioresistance. RESULTS: Nuclear β-catenin overexpression was more evident in radioresistant rectal adenocarcinoma than in radiosensitive rectal adenocarcinoma (57.6% vs 16.7%, P < 0.001). Nuclear β-catenin was overexpressed in favor of poor TRG (≤ 2), whereas membrane β-catenin was expressed in favor of good TRG (≥ 3). Nuclear β-catenin expression in tumor cell differentiation (P = 0.018), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.022), and TRG (P < 0.001) showed significant differences. Univariate analyses demonstrated that radioresistance is associated with nuclear β-catenin overexpression (P < 0.001). In addition, logistic multivariate regression analysis indicated that only three factors, namely, tumor size (P < 0.001), tumor cell differentiation (P < 0.001), and nuclear β-catenin overexpression (P < 0.001), are associated with radioresistance. By using radioresistance as a prediction target, nuclear β-catenin-based prediction alone achieved 83% accuracy, 65% sensitivity, and 88% specificity. CONCLUSION: Nuclear β-catenin overexpression may be a valuable candidate to predict the response of rectal adenocarcinoma to preoperative radiotherapy.

492	Increased spontaneous apoptosis, but not survivin expression, is associated with histomorphologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in rectal cancer	English	2009	19593573	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19593573	Journal Article	\N	36	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Nuclear staining was expressed as the percentage of positively staining cells per 1,000 cells using high-powered light microscopy. Cytoplasmic staining was detected in 4 grades, designated: 1 - Nil, 2 - light, 3 - medium and 4 - strong. Cytoplasmic survivin staining grades 1 and 2 were considered negative, while grades 3 and 4 were considered positive.	The treatment regimen received by all patients consisted of 40-45 Gy radiotherapy delivered on 5 days for 5 weeks. Continuous intravenous 5-fluorouracil (225 mg/㎡/day) was given concurrently with radiotherapy. Surgery was performed approximately 6 weeks after the final dose of radiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Survivin has been shown to be an important mediator of cellular radioresistance in vitro. This study aims to compare survivin expression and apoptosis to histomorphologic responses to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in rectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six pre-treatment biopsies were studied. Survivin mRNA and protein expression plus TUNEL staining for apoptosis was performed. Response to treatment was assessed using a 5-point tumour regression grade. RESULTS: Survivin expression was not found to be predictive of response to RCT (p = NS). In contrast, spontaneous apoptosis was significantly (p = 0.0051) associated with subsequent response to RCT. However, no association between survivin expression and levels of apoptosis could be identified. CONCLUSIONS: This in vivo study failed to support in vitro studies showing an association between survivin and response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These results caution against the translation of the in vitro properties of survivin into a clinical setting.	International Journal of Colorectal Disease	\N
487	Association between the expression of microRNAs and the response of patients with locallyadvanced rectal cancer to preoperative chemoradiotherapy	English	2017	28693154	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28693154	Journal Article	\N	130	80	50	64	\N	[35.0,79.0)	Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription PCR	\N	The validation cohort (enrollment, March 2005-November 2009) was based on a previous randomized phase III trial of 224 patients with resectable T3 ‑ 4 rectal cancer receiving neoadjuvant CRT (50.4 Gy/28 fractions, and concomitant tegafur‑uracil (300 mg/㎡) and L‑leucovorin (22.5 mg /day) with (arm B) or without (arm A) an endorectal boost (10 Gy/2 fractions)).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by mesorectal excision is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The balance between treatment efficacy and toxicity is a major issue in the clinical management of these patients. There is a requirement for the identification of predictive molecular biomarkers for the response of patients to CRT. The present study aimed to analyze the association between microRNA (miRNA/miR) expression and treatment efficacy in patients with LARC who were treated with preoperative CRT. From previous clinical trials, 55 patients for the test cohort and 130 patients for the validation cohort met the criteria for the present investigation. Through reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, the expression of miR-21, -31, -125b, -145 and -630 in the diagnostic biopsies was analyzed. The primary endpoint of tumor regression was evaluated according to Mandard's Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) system. In the test cohort, a significant association was identified between low miRNA-145 expression and TRG1+2 (P=0.0003). Similarly, this association was identified in the validation cohort, although it did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, a significant association between high miRNA-21 expression and TRG1+2 (P=0.035) was observed in the validation cohort. The remaining miRNAs analyzed were not associated with TRG. The results of the present study highlight the clinical importance of miRNAs in LARC and underline the necessity for validation studies in this setting.

EGFR expression at levels (+) and (±) was regarded as negative; strong (++) and medium (+++) levels were considered as positive EGFR expression.	Chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 20 mg/㎡, concomitant with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 700 mg/㎡ for 4 consecutive days during the first and fourth weeks of radiotherapy. The patients received the second course of chemotherapy in case they had neutrophil count ≥1500 cells/mL, platelet count ≥100000/mL, mucosal toxicity ≤grade 2, and creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min. In the external beam radiotherapy, the treatment volume was defined by conventional simulationl; forty Gy in 20 fractions was delivered by anteroposterior (AP) fields. Three to four weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy,  the patients underwent esophagectomy, and the samples were examined by a pathologist, considering the response rate to neoadjuvant treatment, existence of living tumoral cells, and th eextnet of necrosis. The adjuvant chemotherapy was performed after surgery with 25 mg/㎡ cisplatin and 5-FU 425 mg/㎡ for 3 days every 3 weeks (for 3-4 cycles). The patients were followed up every 3 months during the first year, with longer intervals afterwards.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for 80% of all esophageal cancers worldwide. It is the most common histological type of esophageal carcinoma in low-resource countries. ESCC is prevalent in Asian countries, accounting for more than 95% of esophageal cancers. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is involved in cancer development, as its gene is often mutated and/or amplified in cancer cells. According to recent statistics, esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cancer in Iran. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we assessed EGFR overexpression, using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 68 patients with ESCC, undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and esophagectomy in 2011-2014. The treatment protocol included external beam radiotherapy (40 Gy), concomitant with cisplatin 20mg/m2 and 5- fluorouracil (5-FU) 1000 mg/m2 for 4 consecutive days during the first and fourth weeks of treatment. To compare the two groups (EGFR positive and negative) in terms of complete pathologic response, Chi-square test was performed using SPSS version 16. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 59 years (range: 27-70 years), with a female-to-male ratio of 1.06. Overall, 70% of the subjects showed EGFR overexpression. Complete pathologic response to neoadjuvant treatment was significantly higher in EGFR-positive patients (40% vs. 15.8%, P = 0.05). In all cases, 1- and 3-year overall survival rates were 86.6% ± 4.1 and 48% ± 6.9, respectively. The 1- and 3-year disease free survival rates were calculated as 71.8% ± 5.4 and 44.3% ± 6.5, respectively. The overall survival rate was relatively higher in cases with EGFR overexpression, although the difference was not statistically significant (5-year survival rate: 47.9 ± 8.2 vs. 30.9 ± 13, P = 0.23). CONCLUSION: EGFR overexpression was reported in the majority of patients with ESCC in northeastern Iran. Moreover, EGFR overexpression was significantly associated with complete pathologic response.

489	Enrichment of CD133-expressing cells in rectal cancers treated with preoperative radiochemotherapy is an independent marker for metastasis and survival	English	2013	22736392	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22736392	Journal Article	\N	126	90	36	63	63.1000000000000014	\N	Immunohistochemistry	The percentage of PROM1 cells was recorded for each specimen, and a defined semiquantitative scoring system was applied with 0% to 40% positive cells indicating low PROM1 expression and >40% positive cells indicating high PROM1 expression, independent of the staining pattern.	All patients received a cumulative irradiation dose of 50.4 grays (Gy) in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy and concomitant application of chemotherapy with either 5-FU (78 patients; 62%) or combined 5-FU/oxaliplatin (48 patients; 38%). Patients subsequently underwent total mesorectal excision within 6 weeks after completion of RCT. Surgical procedures comprised anterior resections, abdominoperineal resections, and discontinuous resections (Hartmann procedure). Perioperative assessment of TME (total mesorectal excision) quality was performed in all surgical specimens.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The transmembrane glycoprotein CD133 (cluster of differentiation 133; also known as Prominin or PROM1) has been described as a potential stem cell marker in colorectal cancer and is associated with higher tumorigenic potential and resistance to radiochemotherapy (RCT). In this study, CD133 expression was evaluated in pre-RCT tumor biopsies and the corresponding post-RCT surgical specimens from patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma, and expression levels were correlated with histopathologic features and clinical follow-up. METHODS: One hundred twenty-six patients with International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stage II/III rectal cancer who received preoperative 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based RCT within the German Rectal Cancer Trials were investigated. Pre-RCT and post-RCT CD133 expression levels were determined using immunohistochemistry and were correlated with histopathologic parameters, tumor regression grade, cancer recurrence, and patient survival. RESULTS: Compared with pre-RCT biopsies, significantly higher CD133 expression was observed in tumor specimens (P = .01). However, no correlations were observed for either biopsies or tumor specimens between CD133 expression levels, histopathologic characteristics, or survival. In matched analyses of corresponding biopsy/tumor pairs, patients who had an increased fraction of CD133-expressing (CD133+) cells after preoperative RCT had significantly higher residual tumor stages (P = .02) and lower histopathologic tumor regression (P < .01). Moreover, these patients had significantly reduced disease-free survival and cancer-specific overall survival in univariate analysis (P < .001 and P = .004, respectively) and multivariate analysis (P = .003 and P = .024, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The enrichment of CD133+ cancer cells during preoperative RCT was correlated with minor local tumor response, increased distant cancer recurrence, and decreased survival. The current results indicate that the up-regulation of intratumoral CD133 expression, in contrast to absolute pre-RCT and post-RCT CD133 levels, plays an important role in tumor progression and metastasis in patients with rectal cancer who are receiving neoadjuvant RCT.

490	p53 and bcl-2 immunohistochemical alterations in prostate cancer treated with radiation therapy	English	1998	9495727	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9495727	Journal Article	\N	108	108	\N	\N	\N	\N	Immunohistochemistry	Samples were considered immunopositive if more than 10% of the cancer cells demonstrated staining, which was nuclear for TP53 and cytoplasmic for BCL2.	\N	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: Radiation therapy is definitive treatment for localized prostate cancer. It causes cellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, which, if irreparable, results in apoptosis or programmed cell death. Overexpression of mutant p53 and/or bcl-2 proteins prolongs cell survival despite exposure to damaging agents. We examined whether abnormal expression of either gene could help to explain radiation therapy failures in prostate cancer. METHODS: Archival tissue from patients who had failed radiation therapy as treatment for prostate cancer was obtained before and after treatment. These cancer samples were examined immunohistochemically for accumulation of p53 and bcl-2 proteins. Comparison was made with specimens from patients who had no evidence of recurrent or persistent disease at least 3 years following radiation therapy. RESULTS: High rates of p53 immunopositivity were found in the prostate tissue from all groups studied. More patients who had failed radiation therapy were found to have bcl-2 immunopositive specimens than were those without evidence for recurrent disease (41% preradiation and 61% postradiation versus 8%, P <0.05). More patients who failed radiation therapy had both p53 and bcl-2 immunopositive prostate tissue than did those who were treated successfully (32% preradiation and 48% postradiation versus 8%). CONCLUSIONS: bcl-2 immunopositivity, with or without concomitant detection of p53, was found in significantly more cancers of patients who failed radiation therapy. Positive staining for bcl-2 may serve as a marker for determining the radiation sensitivity of a tumor and thus may help to guide treatment options. It is also notable that a high proportion of the prostate cancers examined were immunopositive for p53	Urology	\N

CHUK staining intensity was deﬁned according to the sum of the above scores as negative (-) with zero; weak (+) with 1-2; moderate (++) with 3-5; strong (+++) with 6-7.	The radiation dose was 66-70 Gy in 31-33 fractions in 6-7 wk to planning gross tumor volume (PGTV) in nasopharyngeal and lymph-nodal metastatic lesions, without an interruption of more than 3 d. Fifty-four percent (85/157) of the cases received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mainly consisted of 2 $ 3 cycles of PF (cisplatin 30 mg/㎡/d IV for 3 d, 5-FU 800-1000 mg/㎡ IV in d1-d5) at a 2 wk interval prior to the initiation of radiotherapy. Twenty-four percent (38/157) of the cases received concurrent chemotherapy with DDP 80-100 mg/concurrent chemotherapy with DDP 80-100 mg/m 2 at 3 wk interval. Twenty-two percent (34/157) received radiotherapy alone. at 3 wk interval. Twenty-two percent (34/157) received radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Recent studies have suggested that the action of IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKα) as a tumor suppressor is crucial in the development of skin carcinoma, but its role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unknown. We examined the IKKα expression in specimens from 157 NPC patients by immunohistochemistry and analyzed the effect of IKKα on prognosis. The functional significance of IKKα expression in NPC cell lines was investigated by IKKα overexpression or downregulation in in vitro studies. The in vitro assays revealed that the IKKα expression was negatively correlated with the invasiveness, migration, and angiogenesis of NPC cells. Overexpression or downregulation of IKKα could significantly repress or enhance the above characteristics, respectively, and these effects were independent of IKKα kinase or EBNA1. In 157 NPC cases, IKKα was differentially expressed in NPC tissues. High expression of IKKα was associated significantly with a high disease-free survival (DFS; P = 0.002) or overall survival (OS; P = 0.014). Multivariate analyses showed that the IKKα expression was an independent risk factor for DFS (HR, 2.302; P = 0.011) and OS (HR, 3.578; P = 0.006). Our findings indicated that IKKα plays a crucial role as a tumor suppressor that suppresses the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of NPC cells in vitro and correlates with the survival in NPC patients. Therefore, IKKα is not only a novel independent prognostic indicator in NPC, but also targeting IKKα expression may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for NPC.

493	Low expression levels of hepsin and TMPRSS3 are associated with poor breast cancer survival	English	2015	26014348	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26014348	Journal Article	Caucasian	66	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Quantitative Real-Time PCR	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Hepsin, (also called TMPRSS1) and TMPRSS3 are type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) that are involved in cancer progression. TTSPs can remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) and, when dysregulated, promote tumor progression and metastasis by inducing defects in basement membrane and ECM molecules. This study investigated whether the gene and protein expression levels of these TTSPs were associated with breast cancer characteristics or survival. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate hepsin levels in 372 breast cancer samples and TMPRSS3 levels in 373 samples. TMPRSS1 mRNA expression was determined in 125 invasive and 16 benign breast tumor samples, and TMPRSS3 mRNA expression was determined in 167 invasive and 23 benign breast tumor samples. The gene and protein expression levels were analyzed for associations with breast cancer-specific survival and clinicopathological parameters. RESULTS: Low TMPRSS1 and TMPRSS3 mRNA expression levels were independent prognostic factors for poor breast cancer survival during the 20-year follow-up (TMPRSS1, P = 0.023; HR, 2.065; 95 % CI, 1.106-3.856; TMPRSS3, P = 0.013; HR, 2.106; 95 % CI, 1.167-3.800). Low expression of the two genes at the mRNA and protein levels associated with poorer survival compared to high levels (log rank P-values 0.015-0.042). Low TMPRSS1 mRNA expression was also an independent marker of poor breast cancer prognosis in patients treated with radiotherapy (P = 0.034; HR, 2.344; 95 % CI, 1.065-5.160). Grade III tumors, large tumor size, and metastasis were associated with low mRNA and protein expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the TTSPs hepsin and TMPRSS3 may have similar biological functions in the molecular pathology of breast cancer. Low mRNA and protein expression levels of the studied TTSPs were prognostic markers of poor survival in breast cancer.

494	Cancer-associated fibroblasts correlate with poor prognosis in rectal cancer after chemoradiotherapy	English	2011	21240461	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21240461	Journal Article	\N	52	42	10	64	\N	[37.0,78.0)	Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Immunohistochemistry	\N	The chemoradiotherapy regimen included 4 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) given as a 24-h, 600-mg/㎡ continuous infusion, and tegafur-uracil (UFT) given 400 mg/㎡ orally for 5 days, with concurrent 20-45 gy radiation, followed by resection. This regimen was based on the previously tested combination of continuous-infusion 5-F U plus UFT. The time interval between pre-operative CRT and surgery was 2-3 weeks in surgical patients. A total of 42 patients received shortcourse radiation at 20 gy in 4 fractions over 1 week. The remaining 11 patients received conventionally fractionated radiation at a dose of 45 gy in 25 fractions for 4 weeks. All patients underwent standard surgery including total mesorectal excision, and received 5-Fu-based adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for 6 months to 1 year.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the stroma play an important role in influencing the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP-α) is known as a marker of CAFs, while stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is primarily expressed by CAFs. Herein, we investigated whether the expression levels of these genes are associated with clinical outcome after pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in rectal cancer patients. We obtained total RNA from residual cancer stroma using microdissection from a total of 52 rectal cancer specimens from patients who underwent pre-operative CRT, we performed transcriptional analyses, and the serum protein concentrations in 40 matched microdissected specimens were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Additionally, we sought to clarify the location of FAP-α and SDF-1 expression using immunohistochemical staining. Of the 52 patients, 15.6 and 36.8% showed detectable FAP-α and SDF-1 mRNA expression, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between stromal FAP-α and SDF-1 mRNA levels. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between stromal SDF-1 gene expression levels and serum protein levels. Patients who developed distant recurrences after CRT had positive expression of both genes (P<0.05). The positive expression of both genes was also associated with poor probability of recurrence-free and overall survival (P<0.05). Patients with elevated serum SDF-1 levels had equally poor overall survival as those with positive stromal SDF-1 gene expression (P<0.05). In immunohistochemistry, both FAP-α and SDF-1 expression was observed in certain activated fibroblasts. In conclusion, FAP-α and SDF-1 expression was shown to be involved in tumor re-growth and recurrence in rectal cancer patients treated with pre-operative CRT.

1	RAD51	5888	{BRCC5," FANCR"," HRAD51"," HsRad51"," HsT16930"," MRMV2"," RAD51A"," RECA"}	RAD51 recombinase	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the RAD51 protein family. RAD51 family members are highly similar to bacterial RecA and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51, and are known to be involved in the homologous recombination and repair of DNA. This protein can interact with the ssDNA-binding protein RPA and RAD52, and it is thought to play roles in homologous pairing and strand transfer of DNA. This protein is also found to interact with BRCA1 and BRCA2, which may be important for the cellular response to DNA damage. BRCA2 is shown to regulate both the intracellular localization and DNA-binding ability of this protein. Loss of these controls following BRCA2 inactivation may be a key event leading to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2009].
2	WRN	7486	{RECQ3," RECQL2"," RECQL3"}	Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase	protein-coding	This gene encodes a member of the RecQ subfamily of DNA helicase proteins.

Alternative splicing occurs between a splice site from exon 5 of this gene to the 3' splice site upstream of the open reading frame (ORF) of the adjacent gene, piggyback-derived-3 (GeneID:267004), which activates the alternative polyadenylation site downstream of the piggyback-derived-3 ORF. The resulting transcripts encode a fusion protein that shares sequence with the product of each individual gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2016].
45	CCNH	902	{CAK," CycH"," p34"," p37"}	cyclin H	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the highly conserved cyclin family, whose members are characterized by a dramatic periodicity in protein abundance through the cell cycle. Cyclins function as regulators of CDK kinases. Different cyclins exhibit distinct expression and degradation patterns which contribute to the temporal coordination of each mitotic event. This cyclin forms a complex with CDK7 kinase and ring finger protein MAT1. The kinase complex is able to phosphorylate CDK2 and CDC2 kinases, thus functions as a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). This cyclin and its kinase partner are components of TFIIH, as well as RNA polymerase II protein complexes. They participate in two different transcriptional regulation processes, suggesting an important link between basal transcription control and the cell cycle machinery. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 4. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants.[provided by RefSeq, Nov 2010].

This protein was also shown to interact with, and elevate the nucleotide excision activity of 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase (MPG), which suggested a role in DNA damage recognition in base excision repair. This protein contains an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain, which was reported to interact with 26S proteasome, and thus this protein may be involved in the ubiquitin mediated proteolytic pathway in cells. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2011].

When MutL alpha is bound by MutS beta and some accessory proteins, the PMS2 subunit of MutL alpha introduces a single-strand break near DNA mismatches, providing an entry point for exonuclease degradation. The encoded protein is also involved in DNA damage signaling and can heterodimerize with DNA mismatch repair protein MLH3 to form MutL gamma, which is involved in meiosis.

In E. coli, the MutS protein helps in the recognition of mismatched nucleotides prior to their repair. A highly conserved region of approximately 150 aa, called the Walker-A adenine nucleotide binding motif, exists in MutS homologs. The encoded protein heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form a mismatch recognition complex that functions as a bidirectional molecular switch that exchanges ADP and ATP as DNA mismatches are bound and dissociated.

The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases which catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and is known to metabolize as many as 25% of commonly prescribed drugs. Its substrates include antidepressants, antipsychotics, analgesics and antitussives, beta adrenergic blocking agents, antiarrythmics and antiemetics. The gene is highly polymorphic in the human population; certain alleles result in the poor metabolizer phenotype, characterized by a decreased ability to metabolize the enzyme's substrates. Some individuals with the poor metabolizer phenotype have no functional protein since they carry 2 null alleles whereas in other individuals the gene is absent. This gene can vary in copy number and individuals with the ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype can have 3 or more active copies of the gene.

The encoded protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of this gene.

Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in maintenance of genome stability, specifically the homologous recombination pathway for double-strand DNA repair. The BRCA2 protein contains several copies of a 70 aa motif called the BRC motif, and these motifs mediate binding to the RAD51 recombinase which functions in DNA repair. BRCA2 is considered a tumor suppressor gene, as tumors with BRCA2 mutations generally exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the wild-type allele. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008].

At least three alternatively spliced variants encoding distinct proteins have been reported, two of which encode structurally related isoforms known to function as inhibitors of CDK4 kinase. The remaining transcript includes an alternate first exon located 20 Kb upstream of the remainder of the gene; this transcript contains an alternate open reading frame (ARF) that specifies a protein which is structurally unrelated to the products of the other variants. This ARF product functions as a stabilizer of the tumor suppressor protein p53 as it can interact with, and sequester, the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase MDM2, a protein responsible for the degradation of p53. In spite of the structural and functional differences, the CDK inhibitor isoforms and the ARF product encoded by this gene, through the regulatory roles of CDK4 and p53 in cell cycle G1 progression, share a common functionality in cell cycle G1 control. This gene is frequently mutated or deleted in a wide variety of tumors, and is known to be an important tumor suppressor gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2012].

Unlike most MMP family members, activation of this protein can occur on the cell membrane. This enzyme can be activated extracellularly by proteases, or, intracellulary by its S-glutathiolation with no requirement for proteolytical removal of the pro-domain. This protein is thought to be involved in multiple pathways including roles in the nervous system, endometrial menstrual breakdown, regulation of vascularization, and metastasis.

It encodes a heparin-binding protein, which exists as a disulfide-linked homodimer. This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site.

The encoded protein is also referred to as autocrine motility factor based on an additional function as a tumor-secreted cytokine and angiogenic factor. Defects in this gene are the cause of nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia and a severe enzyme deficiency can be associated with hydrops fetalis, immediate neonatal death and neurological impairment.

Upon activation, this kinase translocates to the nucleus of the stimulated cells, where it phosphorylates nuclear targets. One study also suggests that this protein acts as a transcriptional repressor independent of its kinase activity. The encoded protein has been identified as a moonlighting protein based on its ability to perform mechanistically distinct functions.

Four of the alternate first exons are considered pseudogenes. Each of the remaining nine 5' exons may be spliced to the four common exons, resulting in nine proteins with different N-termini and identical C-termini. Each first exon encodes the substrate binding site, and is regulated by its own promoter.

178	MIR146A	406938	{MIRN146," MIRN146A"," miR-146a"," miRNA146A"}	microRNA 146a	ncRNA	microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. Some of the targets of the encoded miRNA are the transcripts for tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1, interleukin 1-beta, TNF receptor-associated factor 6, and complement factor H.

219	MIRLET7A1	406881	{LET7A1," MIRNLET7A1"," let-7a-1"}	microRNA let-7a-1	ncRNA	microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

This protein is present at telomeres in metaphase of the cell cycle, is a second negative regulator of telomere length and plays a key role in the protective activity of telomeres. While having similar telomere binding activity and domain organization, TERF2 differs from TERF1 in that its N terminus is basic rather than acidic. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
221	CLOCK	9575	{KAT13D," bHLHe8"}	clock circadian regulator	protein-coding	The protein encoded by this gene plays a central role in the regulation of circadian rhythms.

The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with ARNTL (BMAL1) that binds E-box enhancer elements upstream of Period (PER1, PER2, PER3) and Cryptochrome (CRY1, CRY2) genes and activates transcription of these genes. PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and repress their own transcription by interacting in a feedback loop with CLOCK/ARNTL complexes. Polymorphisms in this gene may be associated with behavioral changes in certain populations and with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants.

Mutations in this gene can result in either increased or decreased aromatase activity; the associated phenotypes suggest that estrogen functions both as a sex steroid hormone and in growth or differentiation. Alternative promoter use and alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants that have different tissue specificities. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2016].

SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. This protein is recruited to the TGF-beta receptors through its interaction with the SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA) protein. In response to TGF-beta signal, this protein is phosphorylated by the TGF-beta receptors. The phosphorylation induces the dissociation of this protein with SARA and the association with the family member SMAD4. The association with SMAD4 is important for the translocation of this protein into the nucleus, where it binds to target promoters and forms a transcription repressor complex with other cofactors. This protein can also be phosphorylated by activin type 1 receptor kinase, and mediates the signal from the activin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene.

2	Functional polymorphisms of base excision repair genes XRCC1 and APEX1 predict risk of radiationpneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy	English	2011	21420246	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21420246	Journal Article	White; Black; Hispanic; Asian; Other	165	93	72	63	\N	[35.0,88.0)	The median total radiation dose was 63Gy (range, 50.4 to 84.0 Gy) given at 1.2 to 2.0 Gy/fraction. Of all patients, 19 patients received radiation only, 145 received radiation in combination with chemotherapy, and one received radiation but other therapies were unknown.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To explore whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of base-excision repair genes are predictors of radiation treatment-related pneumonitis (RP), we investigated associations between functional SNPs of ADPRT, APEX1, and XRCC1 and RP development. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We genotyped SNPs of ADPRT (rs1136410 [V762A]), XRCC1 (rs1799782 [R194W], rs25489 [R280H], and rs25487 [Q399R]), and APEX1 (rs1130409 [D148E]) in 165 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who received definitive chemoradiation therapy. Results were assessed by both Logistic and Cox regression models for RP risk. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for the cumulative RP probability by the genotypes. RESULTS: We found that SNPs of XRCC1 Q399R and APEX1 D148E each had a significant effect on the development of Grade ≥2 RP (XRCC1: AA vs. GG, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.97; APEX1: GG vs. TT, adjusted HR = 3.61, 95% CI, 1.64-7.93) in an allele-dose response manner (Trend tests: p = 0.040 and 0.001, respectively). The number of the combined protective XRCC1 A and APEX1 T alleles (from 0 to 4) also showed a significant trend of predicting RP risk (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SNPs of the base-excision repair genes may be biomarkers for susceptibility to RP. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate our findings.

3	Polymorphisms of homologous recombination genes and clinical outcomes of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy	English	2011	21647442	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21647442	Journal Article	White; Black; Other	228	125	103	63	\N	[35.0,88.0)	88.2% patient were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the numbers did not add upp to the total number because of tthe missing information, and 96.8% received radiation doses between 60 and 70 Gy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is the major mechanism to maintain genomic stability in response to irradiation. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in DSB repair genes may affect clinical outcomes among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. We genotyped six potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (i.e., RAD51 -135G>C/rs1801320 and -172G>T/rs1801321, XRCC2 4234G>C/rs3218384 and R188H/rs3218536 G>A, XRCC3 T241M/rs861539 and NBN E185Q/rs1805794) and estimated their associations with overall survival (OS) and radiation pneumonitis (RP) in 228 NSCLC patients. We found a predictive role of RAD51 -135G>C SNP in RP development (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.86, P = 0.010 for CG/CC vs. GG). We also found that RAD51 -135G>C and XRCC2 R188H SNPs were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (adjusted HR = 1.70, 95% CI, 1.14-2.62, P = 0.009 for CG/CC vs. GG; and adjusted HR = 1.70; 95% CI, 1.02-2.85, P = 0.043 for AG vs. GG, respectively) and that the SNP-survival association was most pronounced in the presence of RP. Our study suggests that HR genetic polymorphisms, particularly RAD51 -135G>C, may influence overall survival and radiation pneumonitis in NSCLC patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. Large studies are needed to confirm our findings.	Plos One	Stage IA-IV: 228 patients.
4	Significant Effect of Homologous Recombination DNA Repair Gene Polymorphisms on Pancreatic Cancer Survival	English	2006	16540687	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16540687	Journal Article	\N	244	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	During the entire disease process,  53(14%) received gemcitabine-based chemoradiation; 86(22.8%) received gemcitabine-based chemoradiation plus other type of chemotherapy; 33(8.7%) received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation; 72(19%) received 5-FU-based chemoradiation plus other type of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Genetic variation in DNA repair may affect the clinical response to cytotoxic therapies. We investigated the effect of six single nucleotide polymorphisms of the RecQ1, RAD54L, XRCC2, and XRCC3 genes on overall survival of 378 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who were treated at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center during February 1999 to October 2004 and were followed up to October 2005. Genotypes were determined using the MassCode method. Survival was determined from pathologic diagnosis to death. Patients who were alive at the last follow-up evaluation were censored at that time. Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox regression were used to compare overall survival by genotypes. A significant effect on survival of all patients was observed for RecQ1 and RAD54L genes. The median survival time was 19.2, 14.7, and 13.2 months for the RecQ1 159 AA, AC, and CC genotypes, and 16.4, 13.3, and 10.3 months for RAD54L 157 CC, CT, and TT genotypes, respectively. A significantly reduced survival was associated with the variant alleles of XRCC2 R188H and XRCC3 A17893G in subgroup analysis. When the four genes were analyzed in combination, an increasing number of adverse alleles were associated with a significantly decreased survival. Subgroup analyses have shown that the genotype effect on survival was present among patients without metastatic disease or among patients who receive radiotherapy. These observations suggest that polymorphisms of genes involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks significantly affect the clinical outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer.

5	Association between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and radiotherapy response in high-risk humam papillomavirus-related cervical cancer	Chinese	2015	26643423	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26643423	Journal Article	\N	273	\N	273	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation of cyclin D1 (CCND1) G870A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with radiotherapy response in patients with high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) related cervical cancer. METHODS: A total of 273 patients with cervical cancer, who were confirmed by histopathology and hybrid capture 2 (HC-2) assay and treated by radiotherapy, were enrolled for this study. The correlation of CCND1 G870A polymorphism with tumor response in patients was assessed. RESULTS: Compared with patients with AA genotype, the patients with GG genotype and AA genotype showed lower sensitivity to radio-therapy treatment (adjusted ORGA=2.69, 95% CI 1.28-5.67 and adjusted ORGG=3.28, 95% CI 1.47-7.29, respectively), an increase in risks of recurrence/metastasis (adjusted ORGA=2.52, 95% CI 1.12-5.63 and adjusted ORGG=3.95, 95% CI 1.68-9.26, respectively), and shorter recurrence/metastasis-free survival (PGA=0.010 and PGG=0.045). CONCLUSION: G870A polymorphism is a frequent variation that could be used for evaluate the radio-sensitivity and prognosis for patients with HR-HPV related cervical cancer.

6	Cyclin D1 Gene G870A Polymorphism Predicts Response to Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy and Prognosis in Rectal Cancer	English	2007	17398034	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17398034	Journal Article	Caucasian	70	44	26	64	\N	[39.0,81.0)	Patients were treated in the supine position with a three-ﬁeld isocentric technique (posterior and opposed lateral ﬁelds) using 18-MV photon beams daily, ﬁve times per week. The daily dose at the isocenter was 1.8 Gy; the total dose to the entire pelvis was 45 Gy. For a sphincter-preservation approach, 29 patients with a very low rectal cancer, uT2 or uT3 on endorectal ultrasonography initial staging, and M0 by CT scan received a boost dose of 15 Gy. The boost volume covered the primary tumor plus a 1.5-cm margin using a three-ﬁeld (posterior and oblique) technique. The median time between the ﬁrst day of RT and surgery was 10   3.9 weeks. The choice of surgical procedure was at the surgeon’s discretion. A total proctectomy with complete excision of the mesorectum was systematically performed. For upper tumors of the lower third of the rectum, the rectal section was performed during the abdominal approach, close to the levator ani muscle, and then a per anum mucosectomy was made. For lower tumors, the distal pole of the specimen was dissected through the anus, immediately above the dentate line. For tumors located at or near the superior end of the sphincter ring, an intersphincteric resection was performed with partial or complete removal of the internal sphincter. Bowel continuity was restored by coloanal anastomosis, preferably with a J colonic pouch or directly for a narrow pelvis in obese men. Abdominoperineal resection was performed when the patients had a compromised sphincter function, when the tumor invaded the external anal sphincter or the levator ani muscle, or in case of a bulky tumor within a narrow pelvis. The operative specimen was staged according to the 1987 International Union Against Cancer pTNM staging system. All patients had a R0 resection with lateral margins  1 mm. Postoperative management of enrolled patients was performed according to French standards in use during the inclusion time. Speciﬁcally, patients with a posttherapeutic positive nodal status received an adjuvant regimen of ﬂuorouracil and leucovorin. Moreover, patients who developed local or distant recurrence were treated by various chemotherapy regimens or a second surgical resection.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To investigate whether CCND1 genetic variations associated with a constitutive nuclear protein may influence either the pathologic response to preoperative RT or the prognosis in a series of rectal cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy rectal cancer patients treated by neoadjuvant radiotherapy were included in the study. CCND1 exon 5 mutations were screened, and the G870A polymorphism was assessed for correlation with clinical variables, tumor response, and patient outcome. RESULTS: No exon 5 mutation was found. Concerning the G870A polymorphism, the A/A variant was significantly associated with radiosensitivity (p = 0.022). Moreover, patients harboring the A allele were correlated with a lower risk of local failure (p = 0.017). Also, combination of the G870A polymorphism with the post-therapeutic lymph node status allowed the elaboration of a prognostic index, which accurately distinguished subgroups of patients with predictable recurrence-free (p = 0.003) and overall (p = 0.044) survival. CONCLUSIONS: Although CCND1 exon 5 mutations are rare in rectal cancer, G870A polymorphism is a frequent variation that may predict radiosensitivity and prognosis.

7	The Association between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and Short-Term Response to Radiochemotherpy in Cervical Cancer	Chinese	2014	\N	http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&id=syfckzz201401012	Journal Article	\N	196	\N	196	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Objective: This study was designed to investigate the association of EGFR R497K and -216G/ single nucleotide polymorphisms with radiochemotherapy response in cervical cancer. Methods: The genotype of EGFR R497K and -216G/T were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction (PCR-LDR) in 196 cervical cancer patients whounderwent radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy. Results: Compared with patients with R497K G/G genotype, the patients with A/A genotype had a significantly higher sensitivity to radiochemotherapy treatment (adjusted OR=0.244, 95% CI 0.087 to 0.680). Compared with the patients with -216G/G genotype, the patients with G/T+T/T genotypes had no significant difference in sensitivity to radiochemotherapy (adjusted OR=2.412，95%CI 0. 856 to 6.979). Compared with the patients with R497K G/G genotype, the patients with A/A genotype had a decreased risk of recurrence/metastasis (adjusted OR=0.248, 95% CI 0.078 to 0.786, P<0. 05). Compared with the paitents with -216G/G genotype, the patients with G/T+T/T genotypes had no significant difference in the risk of recurrence/metastasis (adjusted OR=1.027, 95% CI 0.324 to 3.253). Conclusion: In our study, the R497K polymorphisms have a relationship with treatment response and the risk of recurrence/metastasis for cervical cancer. R497K SNP might be a genetic marker for prediction radiochemotherapy response and the risk of recurrence/metastasis of patients with cervical cancer.

8	Acute oral mucositis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy: association with genetic polymorphism in DNA DSB repair genes	English	2014	24350917	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24350917	Journal Article	Chinese Han	120	88	32	\N	47.7999999999999972	[15.0,76.0)	The patients were treated with radiation alone (n = 50) or concurrent radiation and chemotherapy (n = 70). Radiotherapy was performed with a 5- to 7-field intensity-modulated radiation-therapy (IMRT) technique. The prescription doses were 70 Gy in 33 fractions for the gross tumor volume (GTV) and 60 Gy in 33 fractions to the clinical target volumes (CTV). Each fraction applied daily, five fractions per week. Seventy patients were concurrently given platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy. Treatment was delivered by a Siemens accelerator (Primus, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using an integrated motorized multileaf collimator (MLC) for the step-and-shoot technique automatically delivering the sequences.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between polymorphic variants of DNA repair genes with the susceptibility of acute oral mucositis (OM) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 120 NPC patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Among them 70 patients also received concurrent chemotherapy. Genotypes in DNA repair genes Ku70 c.-1310C>G (rs2267437), Ku70 c.1781G> T (rs132788), Ku80 c.2099-2408G> A (rs3835), Ku80 c.*841G> A (rs2440) and DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) c.2888 + 713C> T (rs2213178) were determined by polymerase chain reaction combined with the restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. Mucositis was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events v.3.0 scale. The population was divided into the CTC0-2 group (CTC toxicity grade 0, 1 and 2) and the CTC3 + group (CTC toxicity grade 3 and above). Odd ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A significant difference in Ku70 c.1781G> T genotype distribution was observed between the CTC0-2 and CTC3 + groups for the 120 patients analyzed. The GG carriers were at higher risks for severe OM (CTC3+) compared with the TT homozygotes (OR = 3.000, 95% CI = 1.287-6.994, p = 0.011). No association was found between Ku70 (c.-1310C> G), Ku80 (c.2099-2408G> A, c.*841G> A), DNA-PKcs (c.2888 + 713 C > T) and the development of severe oral mucositis. Stratification analyses for the 50 patients treated with radiation alone further confirmed the association between the variant genotype of GG and severe OM (OR = 5.128, 95% CI = 1.183-22.238, p = 0.029). Concurrent radiochemotherapy increased the risk of severe OM for both the TT homozygotes and GG genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the Ku70 c.1781G> T polymorphism may be a susceptibility factor for radiation-induced oral mucositis in Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients.

Thirty patients were treated exclusively with RT, and 23 patients had adjuvant RT after complete or incomplete surgical resection of the tumor. Fourteen patients received combined primary radiochemotherapy.Twenty-one patients had surgery followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy. In all cases, chemotherapy was cisplatin-based.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To investigate the association between dose-related parameters and polymorphisms in DNA DSB repair genes XRCC3 (c.-1843A>G, c.562-14A>G, c.722C>T), Rad51 (c.-3429G>C, c.-3392G>T), Lig4 (c.26C>T, c.1704T>C), Ku70 (c.-1310C>G), and Ku80 (c.2110-2408G>A) and the occurrence of acute reactions after radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 88 intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)-treated head-and-neck cancer patients. Mucositis, dermatitis, and dysphagia were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events v.3.0 scale. The population was divided into a CTC0-2 and CTC3+ group for the analysis of each acute effect. The influence of the dose on critical structures was analyzed using dose-volume histograms. Genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism or PCR-single base extension assays. RESULTS: The mean dose (D(mean)) to the oral cavity and constrictor pharyngeus (PC) muscles was significantly associated with the development of mucositis and dysphagia, respectively. These parameters were considered confounding factors in the radiogenomics analyses. The XRCC3c.722CT/TT and Ku70c.-1310CG/GG genotypes were significantly associated with the development of severe dysphagia (CTC3+). No association was found between the investigated polymorphisms and the development of mucositis or dermatitis. A risk analysis model for severe dysphagia, which was developed based on the XRCC3c.722CT/TT and Ku70c.-1310CG/GG genotypes and the PC dose, showed a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 77.6%. CONCLUSIONS: The XRCC3c.722C>T and Ku70c.-1310C>G polymorphisms as well as the D(mean) to the PC muscles were highly associated with the development of severe dysphagia after IMRT. The prediction model developed using these parameters showed a high sensitivity and specificity.

Methods: One-hundred-and-sixty-seven lung cancer patients receiving radiotherapy were enrolled in the study. The single nucleotide polymorphisms of 8 DNA repair genes (NEIL1: rs4462560 and rs7402844; hOGG1: rs1052133 and rs293795; FEN1: rs174538 and rs4246215; ERCC2: rs238406, and ERCC5: rs2296147) were detected by polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. The correlation between the genotypes and the incidence of ≥grade 2 acute radiation pneumonitis were analyzed. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used to examine the effect of the SNPs in the 5'UTR region of ERCC5 on gene transcription. Result: Of the 167 patients with lung cancer, 34 patients (20.4%) developed radiation pneumonia. No significant differences in clinical parameters or physical parameters were detected between the patients with radiation pneumonitis and those without radiation pneumonitis (control group) shown by χ2 test or t tests (P > 0.05). Logistic regression analysis suggested that CC, CT and CT/CC genotypes of ERCC5 rs2296147 were correlated with ≥grade 2 acute radiation pneumonia (P<0.05), but TT genotype of the same location has no correlation with ≥grade 2 acute radiation pneumonia (P>0.05). Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that the transcription level of ERCC5 was downregulated in patients with CC genotype of ERCC5 rs2296147. Conclusion: SNPs of ERCC5 rs2296147 was related to radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients, which may be a new indicator to predict the risks of radiation pneumonitis.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	EGFR overexpression has been implicated in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study evaluates the prognostic ability of four polymorphisms in EGFR gene for patients diagnosed with HNSCC and treated with chemoradiation. EGFR polymorphisms in the promoter region were not associated with clinical or pathological characteristics. In relation to R497K polymorphism, patients with the Arg/Arg genotype showed the highest risk of disease-specificity mortality and none of the patients with the Lys/Lys genotype died throughout the follow-up period of the study. Patients with (CA)(n) repeats <17 in both alleles tended toward inferior overall survival compared with those with (CA)(n) repeats > or = 17 in both alleles (p=0.07). Moreover, the distribution of patients with any (CA)(n) repeats > or = 17 and both alleles <17 was statistically different across patients who were recorded as having partial response or no response to therapy (p=0.034). Combination analysis of both polymorphisms, (CA)(n) repeats and R497K, suggests that these polymorphisms may be associated with clinical outcome in patients treated with chemoradiation.

[Methods] Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood of 65 advanced lung cancer patients underwent radiotherapy. Allelic discrimination of GNAS1 was performed by quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction. Genetyping was correlated with curative effect of radiotherapy and radiation-induced hematological toxicity, esophagitis and pneumonia. The endpoint was grade≥3 hematological toxicity and grade≥2 radiation-induced esophagitis and pneumonia. The Chi-square criterion method and Logistic regression analysis were used to assess the significance of the clinical factors and genotypes for curative effect of radiotherapy and radiation-induced hematological toxicity, esophagitis and pneumonitis. [Results] Median age was 61 years old (ranged 35 to 80 years). At univariate analysis, chemotherapy could improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in lung cancer (P=0.045), but increased the hematotoxicity (P =0.004). Patients with squanae type and allele T carrier in GNAS1 T393C gene had more higher incidence of radiation pneumonitis (P=0.015, P=0.035). [Conclusions] Genetic polymorphism in the GNAS1 T393C might relate to radiation pneumonitis, which may be a prognostic factor. The results need large sample research to identify.

Methods: The MnSOD Ala16Val was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis in 93 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients. All patients received 3D-CRT or the conventional radiotherapy. Results: The frequency of TT and CT/CC allelotype among three grades of curative effect were 59.1%, 40.9%; 77.8%, 22.2%; 62.5%, 37.5% respectively. There was no statistical difference in allelotype distribution between three grades. When the length of esophagus cancer was  5cm or less than, there was no statistical difference in allelotype distribution between three grades of curative effect. But when the length was more than 5cm, a significant diffenence was observed in the MnSOD allelotype distribution among different length (chi-square=2.658, P<0.05). The curative effect of radiotherapy in patients with CT/CC allelotype was better than patients with allelotype TT when the length was more than 5cm. There was no difference of MST and 1-year survival rates in patients with TT genotype and TC/CC genotype (17 months, 68%, 35.2% vs 22 months, 73%, 34.62%, P>0.05).

All patients were given whole breast radiotherapy with conventional fractionation (50-50.4 Gy; 1.8-2 Gy/fraction), with photons (6-18 MV) or 60 Co grays (1.25 MV). Treatment was followed by electron (9-10.5 MeV) in 235 of 257 cases (91.4%) or orthovoltage (200 kV x-rays) boost (9-16 Gy; 1.5-3 Gy/fraction) in 22 of 257 cases (8.6%) according to tumor characteristics.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To provide new insights into the genetic basis of normal tissue radiosensitivity, we evaluated the association between eight polymorphic variants located in six genes related to DNA repair mechanisms, oxidative stress, and fibroblast proliferation (XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC1 Arg194Trp, TP53 Arg72Pro, GSTP1 Ile105Val, GSTA1 C-69T, eNOS G894T, TGFβ1 C-509T, and TGFβ1 T869C) and the risk of subcutaneous fibrosis in a retrospective series of patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subcutaneous fibrosis was scored according to the Late Effects of Normal Tissue--Subjective Objective Management Analytical scale in 257 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy. Genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction--restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood. The association between genetic variants and the risk of moderate to severe fibrosis was evaluated by binary logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven patients were available for the analysis. Among them, 41 patients (17.3%) developed moderate to severe fibrosis (Grade 2-3), and 196 (82.7%) patients displayed no or minimal fibrotic reactions (Grade 0-1). After adjustment of confounding factors, GSTP1 Ile105Val (odds ratio [OR] 2.756; 95% CI, 1.188-6.393; p = 0.018), GSTA1 C-69T (OR 3.223; 95% CI, 1.176-8.826; p = 0.022), and TGFβ1 T869C (OR 0.295; 95% CI, 0.090-0.964; p = 0.043) polymorphisms were found to be significantly associated with the risk of Grade 2-3 radiation-induced fibrosis. In the combined analysis, carriers of three risk genotypes were found to be at higher odds for the development of Grade 2-3 fibrosis than were patients with two risk genotypes (OR 4.415; 95% CI, 1.553-12.551, p = 0.005) or with no or one risk genotype (OR 8.563; 95% CI, 2.671-27.447; p = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that functional variations in genes involved in oxidative stress response and fibroblast proliferation may modulate the development of radiation-induced fibrosis in breast cancer patients. The results of the combined analysis support the notion that approaches based on the combination of different genetic markers have the potential to predict normal tissue responses.

Given that folate participates in important intracellular pathways, such as nucleotide synthesis and biomolecule methylation, it seems plausible that patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) may respond differently to radiotherapy treatments, based on genetic polymor-phisms. Therefore, this study sought to understand the role of these polymorphisms in HNSCC patient radiotherapy response. Genotypes were detected by PCR-RFLP after extraction of DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Survival curves were analyzed by the Kaplan- Meier model, and significant differences were analyzed by the Wil-coxon test. Response to radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal SCC was significantly associated with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism (P = 0.030). Indeed, the presence of at least one T allele decreases the mortality rate up to 3-fold. Therefore, we propose that MTHFR C677T may represent a putative biomarker for radiotherapy prognosis in la-ryngeal SCC patients.	Genetics and Molecular Research	\N

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Nitric oxide (NO), is endogenously synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), exhibits a dual role in sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in NOS genes on treatment response of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients after radiochemotherapy. A cohort of 198 NSCLC patients treated with radiochemotherapy between 2009 and 2011 were included in this study. Genotyping analyses of 35 SNPs ( NOS2A, 21 and NOS3, 14) in each sample were conducted by using the Sequenom MassArray system. Unconditional logistic regression was performed to assess the association between treatment response and each genotype while adjusting or not for other covariates. Of 198 patients, 87 (43.9%) had objective responses, and 111(56.1%) did not respond. We observed no significant associations between treatment response and each genotype. While adjusting for other covariates, the associations were also not significant. Our results suggest that genetic variations within the NOS2A and NOS3 genes may not influence the treatment response in NSCLC patients with radiochemotherapy. Future studies in this problem are required to confirm our findings.	Neoplasma	Stage III: 106 patients, Stage IV: 92 patients.

The median radiation dose was 59.6 Gy (range, 40–80.6 Gy); 82.4% (N = 248) of patients received 50–70 Gy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nitric oxide (NO), mainly synthesized by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) in pathological conditions, plays an important role in cytotoxicity, inflammation and fibrosis. Elevations in exhaled NO after thoracic radiation have been reported to predict radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). This study examined whether genetic variations in NOS2 gene is associated with the risk of RILI. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 301 patients between 2009 and 2011 were genotyped for 21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS2 gene by the Sequenom MassArray system. Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability was used to assess RILI risk and Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of NOS2 genotypes on RILI. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis found that three SNPs (rs2297518, rs1137933 and rs16949) in NOS2 were significantly associated with risk of RILI ≥2 (P value=0.001, 0.000092, 0.001, respectively) after adjusting for other covariates. Their associations were independent of radiation dose and mean lung dose. Further haplotype analysis indicated that the ATC haplotype of three SNPs is associated with reducing the risk of developing RILI. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that genetic variants of NOS2 may serve as a reliable predictor of RILI in lung cancer patients treated with thoracic radiation.

22	Association of polymorphism of codon 72 in p53 gene with susceptibility and radiosensitivity of non small cell lung cancer in Chinese population	Chinese	2006	21144305	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21144305	Journal Article	\N	50	25	25	\N	62.6000000000000014	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and its mortality rate has increased year after year. Molecular biology has contributed to make people's understanding to the disease at the gene level. A new idea will be given to the early diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer with the method of molecular biology which can be used to find the association between some genes and lung cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between polymorphism of codon 72 (BstU I single nucleotide polymorphism, BstU I SNP) in p53 gene and susceptibility and radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Chinese population. METHODS: The BstU I single nucleotide polymorphic sites at condon 72 in exon 4 of p53 gene in 50 patients with NSCLC as well as 50 healthy controls were inspected by polymerase chain reaction-restricted fragment length polymorphism assay and the relationship between BstU I SNP and susceptibility and radiosensitivity of NSCLC was analysed by case-control test. RESULTS: The allelic distribution of the three genotypes (A1/A1, A1/A2, A2/A2) in healthy controls was 32.0%, 42.0% and 26.0% respectively, which differed slightly from that of lung cancer patients, which was 28.0%, 32.0% and 40.0%. These allelic and genotype differences between control and lung cancer groups (A1/A1 OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.36-1.27 and A2/A2 OR=1.90, 95% CI 0.82-4.42) were insignificant. The patients with A1/A1 or A2/A2 genotype were sensitive to radiotherapy and the patients with A1/A2 were not sensitive to radiother-apy (Chi-square=9.2, P < 0.05), the effective rate to radiotherapy were 71.4%, 70.0% and 25.0% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant relationship between the BstUI SNP in p53 and susceptibility in NSCLC .The p53 BstU I SNP is closely associated with radiosensitivity of NSCLC in the Northern Chinese population.

Methods: Polymerase chain reaction technology for 122 cases (60 cases of non-small cell lung cancer and 62 cases of healthy people) of transforming growth factor TGFβ1 T29C in Hunan Province was amplified, PCR products were sequenced directly with ABI instrument. Statistics NSCLC group and the healthy control group genotyping analysis of the situation and the correlation between genotype and radiotherapy. Results: 1. The tested genetic polymorphisms frequency distribution in control group and NSCLC group were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium law. T and C allele frequencies in NSCLC group and the control group were 51.7%, 58.1% and 48.3%, 41.9% respectively. TT, TC, CC genotype frequencies in NSCLC group were 28.3%, 46.7% and 25.0%. TT, TC, CC genotype frequency in control group was 33.9%, 48.4% and 17.7%, but the difference between the two groups is not significant. 2. Effective rate of radiotherapy in NSCLC patients with TC genotype was only 28.6%, CC genotype in NSCLC patients was 50.0%, and a higher efficiency of 64.7% in the TT genotype in patients with radiotherapy, and the difference was significant (χ 2 = 6.125, P<0.05). Conclusion: There is no significant relationship between the T29C SNP in TGF β 1 and susceptibility in NSCLC. The TGF β 1 T29C SNP is closely associated with radiosensitivity of NSCLC in the ethnic Han Chinese in Hunan province.	Journal of Hunan Normal University (Medical Sciences)	Stage IIIB: 60 patients.

Methods: Patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received radiation therapy (RT) were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from blood samples. SNPs of APE1 and XRCC1 were determined using PCR-RFLP methods. Genotypes from the SNPs were compared between radiosensitive group and radioresistant group. Results: The total response rate of radiotherapy was 83.3% in 150 esophageal cancer patients. For XRCC1 Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, Gln/Gln genotypes, the response rates to radiotherapy were 59.4%, 88.4% and 90.7%, respectively, and there was statistical difference among three genotypes. The response rate for APE1 Asp/Glu was 87. 6%, higher than that for Asp/Asp(75.5%), but there was no statistical difference. In patients with APE1 194Asp/Glu and XRCC1399 Gln/Gln genotype, the respond rate was higher than that of the others. Conclusion: SNP of XRCC1 Arg399Gln is associated with radiation sensitivity of the esophageal cancer. APE1 Asp148Glu SNP and XRCC1 may have synergistic effect on radiosensitivity.

25	Significance of XRCC1 Codon399 polymorphisms in Chinese patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiation therapy	English	2016	23910235	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23910235	Journal Article	\N	60	52	8	55	\N	[27.0,72.0)	Head and shoulder immobilized by thermoplastic mask, the patients were treated with external irradiation after CT simulation scanning and three-dimensional treatment planning. 3DCRT was applied with 6 MV X-ray (SIEMENS Primus Linear Accelerator, Munich, Germany), 2 Gy per fractionation, five times a week. The total dose of primary tumor was 66–76 Gy in nasopharynx and 66 Gy in metastatic neck lymph nodes. The elective neck dose was 50–56 Gy. Electron beam integrated boost planning was designed for those residual metastatic lymph nodes with 9–12 MeV electron beam pushing total dose to 66–76 Gy. All patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before RT with TP regimen, that is, docetaxel (T) 75 mg/㎡, day 1; cisplatin (P) 25 mg/㎡, days 1–3. RT started 1 week later after one cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two or three cycles of concurrent chemoradiotherapy were delivered followed by two to four cycles adjuvant chemotherapy with the same TP regimen. All the chemotherapies were given every 3 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIM: Little is known about the relationship between XRCC1 Codon399 polymorphisms and radiotherapy (RT) outcomes in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). We aimed to investigate whether XRCC1 Codon399 polymorphisms were correlated to treatment efficacy and normal tissue toxicity in Chinese patients with locally advanced NPC after RT. METHODS: Sixty eligible patients with NPC stage III-IVa were recruited. Patients received definitive RT, 66-76 Gy. One cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin regimen was used before RT, two or three cycles for concurrent chemo-RT followed by two to four cycles adjuvant chemotherapy with the same regimen. Before the treatment, XRCC1 Codon399 polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction based ligase detection reaction methods. RESULTS: Six of 60 NPC patients were homozygous for XRCC1 Codon399 Gln/Gln and 35% were heterozygous. The expressions of genotypes were unrelated to gender, age, clinical stage, T stage or N stage. Codon399 Gln/Gln allele correlated with a higher medium-term tumor regression ratio after RT for primary nasopharyngeal neoplasm and metastatic lymph nodes (>80% vs 40-60%, P < 0.01). Compared with other two genotypes, patients with XRCC1 Codon399 Gln/Gln allele were more likely to obtain complete remission of tumor (100% vs 76 and 67%, P > 0.05). No correlation between XRCC1 Codon399 polymorphisms and acute or late radiation-induced injury of normal tissues was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The XRCC1 Codon399 Gln/Gln allele may be associated with better tumor regression, and is suggested as a promising predictive factor for outcome for locally advanced NPC.

26	Among 45 variants in 11 genes, HDM2 promoter polymorphisms emerge as new candidate biomarker associated with radiation toxicity	English	2014	28324443	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28324443	Journal Article	\N	155	116	39	47	\N	[15.0,77.0)	This cancer site is mainly treated with radiation, with or without chemotherapy, but it does not involve surgery. The treatment was fairly standardized and planned using CT-based (computerized tomography) 3D conformal technique. The upper neck including the primary tumor site (nasopharynx) received the maximum dose through two parallel–opposed–lateral fields using 6 MV photon linear accelerator. Total radiation dose to the upper neck was 66 Gy delivered using 2 Gy per fraction per day over 6.5 weeks. Where possible, patients (n = 47) received a boost of two additional fractions to the nasopharynx to bring the dose received to 70 Gy in 7 weeks. In addition, locally advanced stages (II–IVB, n = 74) received neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy consisting of cisplatinum and epirubicin.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Due to individual variations in radiosensitivity, biomarkers are needed to tailor radiation treatment to cancer patients. Since single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are frequent in human, we hypothesized that SNPs in genes that mitigate the radiation response are associated with radiotoxicity, in particular late complications to radiotherapy and could be used as genetic biomarkers for radiation sensitivity. A total of 155 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer were included in the study. Normal tissue fibrosis was scored using RTOG/EORTC grading system. Eleven candidate genes (ATM, XRCC1, XRCC3, XRCC4, XRCC5, PRKDC, LIG4, TP53, HDM2, CDKN1A, TGFB1) were selected for their presumed influence on radiosensitivity. Forty-five SNPs (12 primary and 33 neighboring) were genotyped by direct sequencing of genomic DNA. Patients with severe fibrosis (cases, G3-4, n = 48) were compared to controls (G0-2, n = 107). Results showed statistically significant (P < 0.05) association with radiation complications for six SNPs (ATM G/A rs1801516, HDM2 promoter T/G rs2279744 and T/A rs1196333, XRCC1 G/A rs25487, XRCC5 T/C rs1051677 and TGFB1 C/T rs1800469). We conclude that these six SNPs are candidate genetic biomarkers for radiosensitivity in our patients that have cumulative effects as patients with severe fibrosis harbored significantly higher number of risk alleles than the controls (P < 0.001). Larger cohort, independent replication of these findings and genome-wide association studies are required to confirm these results in order for SNPs to be used as biomarkers to individualize radiotherapy on genetic basis.	3 Biotech	Stage II-IVB: 74 patients.

After 3 weeks, concurrent chemoradiotherapy was performed. All patients received radical IMRT, and the range of therapy covered from the skull base to the clavicle. Computed tomography (CT) simulation positioning was used in all patients, and the target delineation was performed by CT and MRI fusion. According to the ICRU 50 (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements) and Report No. 62, radiotherapy target was delineated, as well as contiguous threatening of organs such as brainstem and spinal cord. Radiotherapy was conducted using a 6-MV X-ray from Elekta precise linear accelerator (Version 10.0.28; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). The radiotherapy dosage to the nasopharynx and neck in the presence of positive lymph node 70 to 76Gy. The radiotherapy dose of CTV1 and CTV2 were 60 to 66Gy and 54 to 60Gy, respectively. All radiotherapies were performed once daily, 5 times/week. In the concurrent chemo- radiotherapy session, single cisplatinum regimen for 3 weeks was applied (cisplatinum 75mg/㎡).

Methods: Patients with exogenous type cervical squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by histopathology were selected for our study. These include: patients in stage I (4 cases), patients in stage II (36 cases), patients in stage III (30 cases), patients in stage IV (3 cases). There are 30 patients with tumor diameter less than 4 cm and 43 patients with tumor diameter over 4 cm in our test. There are 36 cases with dose point A less than 80 Gy and 37 cases with dose point A over 80 Gy . Radiotherapy outcomes showed 47 cases of complete remission and 26 cases of part remission. Polymorphisms Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln of XRCC1 gene in 73 cervical cancer patients were analyzed by mismatch amplification polymerase chain reaction (MAMA-PCR). Results: Arg/Arg, Arg/Trp, TrP/ Trp of Arg194Trp genotype distribution were 31 (42.5%), 37 (50.7%), 5 (6.8%) respectively. Arg/Arg, Arg/Gln, Gln/Gln of Arg399Gln distribution were 6 (35.6%), 39 (53.4%), 8 (11.0%) respectively. The response to radiotherapy was not statistically significant in three genotypes, Arg/Arg, Arg/Trp, TrP/Trp of XRCC1 at codon 194(P > 0.05). Neither was XRCC1 at codon 399. Multivariate analysis showed that late clinical stage was a risk factor of part remission. Conclusion: SNP of XRCC1 gene at codon 194 and codon 399 could not predict clinical response of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of cervix to radiotherapy.

Methods: A total of 152 patients with pathology-confirmed cervical cancer admitted in our hospital from July 2011 to June 2015 were recruited in this study. Single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPS) in XRCC1 gene were analyzed by Sanger sequencing, and the results were evaluated with the occurrences of acute radiotherapy-induced cystitis and proctitis in the patients. Results: In the cohort, there were 78, 56 and 18 patients respectively carrying XRCC1 Arg /Arg, Arg /Gln, and Gln /Gln,and 47 cases of grade 2-3 acute cystitis, 100 of grade 2-3 acute proctitis and none of grade 4 cystitis and proctitis. After adjustment for other clinical factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that the patients carrying XRCC1 399Arg/Gln and 399Gln/Gln had higher risk for the development of grade 2-3 cystitis when compared with those carrying wide type (OR=4.114,95% CI: 1.746-9.693; OR=9.096; 95% CI: 2.707 -30.566) ,and were prone to having of grade 2-3 proctitis (OR=5. 011,95% CI: 2.169-11.575; OR=7.165; 95% CI: 1.506-34.092).

Methods: 60 patients with pathologically confirmed squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or large cell carcinoma were respectively analyzed. The genotype of XRCC1 Codon399 was detected by xTAG liquid chip. The late irradiation-induced injury was evaluated 3 months after radiotherapy. Results: There was no significant difference involved radio-sensitivity. The patients with Arg/Gln heterozygote had a higher rate of acute radiationinduced pulmonary injury than the others (P<0.05), meanwhile the patients with Arg/Gln heterozygote and Gln/Gln homozygote were easier to injury mucous membrane of gastrointestinal tract (P<0.05). There was no significant difference among the three genotypes involved cute irradiation-induced injury with skin, pharynx and esophagus, leukocyte blood platelet (P>0.05). Conclusion: The single nucleotide polymorphism of XRCC1 Codon399 has nothing to do with radio-sensitivity, and it is associated with acute irradiation-induced injury with pulmonary and gastrointestinal tract in patients with advanced NSCLC.

Methods: Included in the study were 230 patients diagnosed with inoperable advanced NSCLC. Pre-treatment anticoagulated blood was collected for extraction of genomic DNA. The Taqman method was used to genotype single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and APE1 Asn148Gln. Results: Among patients who received chemotherapy or radiotherapy only, no correlation was found between genetic polymorphism and treatment response, either XRCC1 or APE1. For patients who were treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, there were no significant association of treatment response with genetic variant in XRCC1, but correlation with APE1 Asn148Gln (TG). Patients with IIIa or IIIb without pleural effusion carrying TG or GG at Asn148Gln were 3.25 times likely not to response to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy than those with TT. Conclusion: APE1 Asn148Gln may be a predictor for response rate to radiochemotherapy depending on stage. Homozygous wild-type genotype TT(Asn148Asn)  may be a marker of radiochemotherapy sensitivity in the NSCLC patients with IIIa or IIIb without pleural effusion.

METHODS: We applied a pathway-based approach to examine the impact of a comprehensive panel of genetic polymorphisms on clinical outcomes in 210 esophageal cancer patients. RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazards model, MTHFR Glu429Ala variant genotypes were associated with significantly improved survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89) in patients treated with fluorouracil (FU). The 3-year survival rates for patients with the variant genotypes and the wild genotypes were 65.26% and 46.43%, respectively. Joint analysis of five polymorphisms in three FU pathway genes showed a significant trend for reduced recurrence risk and longer recurrence-free survival as the number of adverse alleles decreased (P = .004). For patients receiving platinum drugs, the MDR1 C3435T variant allele was associated with significantly reduced recurrence risk (HR = 0.25; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.64) and improved survival (HR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.85). In nucleotide excision repair genes, there was a significant trend for a decreasing risk of death with a decreasing number of high-risk alleles (P for trend = .0008). In base excision repair genes, the variant alleles of XRCC1 Arg399Gln were significantly associated with the absence of pathologic complete response (odds ratio = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.14 to 6.12) and poor survival (HR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.72). CONCLUSION: Several biologically plausible associations between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms and clinical outcomes were found. Our data also strongly suggest that combined pathway-based analysis may provide valuable prognostic markers of clinical outcomes.

38	Association of DNA repair and steroid metabolism gene polymorphisms with clinical late toxicity in patients treated with conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer	English	2006	16638864	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16638864	Journal Article	Caucasian; Caucasian-French Canadian; Canadian; Pacific Asian; Afro-Caribbean	83	87	\N	67	\N	[45.0,78.0)	All patients underwent a pelvic computed tomography scan with contrast urethrography. Custom-expanded foam immobilization casts were used for the majority of patients; however, implanted prostatic fiducial markers were not employed at the time of this study. The clinical target volume (prostatic tissue containing biopsy-proven adencarcinoma or its suspected microscopic extensions) was typically considered to be the entire prostate gland ± bilateral seminal vesicles. Axial clinical target volume images underwent segmentation with digital delineation of clinical target volume, planning target volume (a 10-mm tangential expansion of the clinical target volume), rectum form anorectal junction to retosigmoid junction (as per the guidelines of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 1994-2006 clinical trial; ref. 3), and entire bladder using the Helax TMS treatment planning system versions 5  to 6 (Nucletron Canada, Kanata, Ontario, Canada). The organ at risk (rectum, bladder, and proximal femoral bones) were delineated as "solid" organs. 3-DCRT was planned using beam's eye view techniques with either custom cerrobend of multileaf collimator shaped fileds using anterior, posterior, right, and left lateral 15 to 18 MV X-rays (Varian Medical Systems, Corona, CA). A few patiens received treatment with right and left anterior oblique fields in addition to the four fields descried above. The planning target volume received a mean dose of 77.1 Gy (range, 68.3-82.1Gy) in five daily fractions per week. The number of fractions ranged from 35 to 44, and in al patients, the planning target volume received a minimum dose per fraction of 1.8 to 2Gy. Pelvic lymph nodes were not treated by intention in any patient. Doses to "partial" volumes of the organs at risk and planning target volume were recorded form the dose-volume histograms at each "decile" of fractional volume (i.e., 10%, 20%, 30%, etc.) At the discretion of treating radiation oncologist, short-course (2-4 months pre 3-DCRT) neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (leuprolide depot, goserelin acetate, or burserelin ± flutamide) was given to 35 patients (42%). Adjuvant post-radiation hormonal therapy (typically for 2 years after 3-DCRT) was given to six patients (7%).	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: To explore the possible relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in candidate genes encoding DNA damage recognition/repair/response and steroid metabolism proteins with respect to clinical radiation toxicity in a retrospective cohort of patients previously treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3-DCRT) for prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred twenty-four patients with prostate cancer underwent 3-DCRT at our institution between September 1996 and December 2000. Of these, 83 consented for follow-up of blood sampling and SNP analysis. Twenty-eight patients were documented as having experienced grade >/=2 late bladder or rectal toxicity (scoring system of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group) on at least one follow-up visit. We analyzed 49 SNPs in BRCA1, BRCA2, ESR1, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, NBN, RAD51, RAD52, LIG4, ATM, BCL2, TGFB1, MSH6, ERCC2, XPF, NR3C1, CYP1A1, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, CYP2D6, CYP11B2, and CYP17A1 genes using the Pyrosequencing technique. RESULTS: Significant univariate associations with late rectal or bladder toxicity (grade >/=2) were found for XRCC3 (A>G 5' untranslated region NT 4541), LIG4 (T>C Asp(568)Asp), MLH1 (C>T, Val(219)Ile), CYP2D6*4 (G>A splicing defect), mean rectal and bladder dose, dose to 30% of rectum or bladder, and age <60 years. On Cox multivariate analysis, significant associations with toxicity were found for LIG4 (T>C, Asp(568)Asp), ERCC2 (G>A, Asp(711)Asp), CYP2D6*4 (G>A, splicing defect), mean bladder dose >60 Gy, and dose to 30% of rectal volume >75 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified SNPs in LIG4, ERCC2, and CYP2D6 genes as putative markers to predict individuals at risk for complications arising from radiation therapy in prostate cancer.

Radiotherapy was administered five times a week at a dose of 2 Gy/day. The accumulated dose of radiation was 68–72 Gy to the primary tumor, 60–62 Gy to the involved areas of the neck, and 50 Gy to the uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was administered to 39 patients and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy to 40 patients. As concurrent chemoradiotherapy, DDP (100 mg/㎡) was administered on days 1, 22 and 43 during radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53, MDM2 and p21 genes of the p53 pathway have been extensively studied. The main aim of the current retrospective study was to evaluate the possible predictive value of SNPs in the p53 pathway in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in response to radiotherapy. In total, 75 consecutive patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were enrolled. Three SNPs in the p53 pathway were identified using the Sanger sequencing method from retrospectively collected paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. The effects of genetic polymorphisms on patient progression‑free survival (PFS) were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. All of the selected subjects completed questionnaires on smoking habits prior to treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that the p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro genotype [hazard ratio (HR), 0.300; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.092-0.983; P=0.047] and heavy smoking (≥30 pack-years) (HR, 2.899; 95% CI, 1.349-6.229; P=0.006) are independent significant prognostic factors for PFS in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Moreover, mean times to disease progression for heavy smokers (≥20 pack-years) carrying p53 codon 72 Arg/Arg, p21 codon 31 Arg/Arg and MDM2 309 SNP G/G genotypes were only 14.78 ± 3.00, 11.00 ± 0.58 and 11.17 ± 1.85 months, respectively. These time scales were less than half of those recorded for patients containing other genotypes and moderate smokers (<20 pack-years). In conclusion, the p53 codon 72 polymorphism is an independent prognostic marker for locoregionally advanced NPC. Moreover, analysis of SNPs in the p53 pathway may facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of poor disease outcome in subgroups of heavy smokers.

40	ATM haplotypes and cellular response to DNA damage: association with breast cancer risk and clinical radiosensitivity	English	2003	14695186	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14695186	Journal Article	\N	254	\N	254	\N	56.7999999999999972	[35.0,81.0)	The average treatment dose was 50Gy, in dose fractions of 2.5Gy over a 6-week period, followed by a 10Gy boost to the tumor bed.	Radiotherapy	5	The ATM gene, mutated in the cancer-prone and radiation-sensitive syndrome ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), could predispose to breast cancer (BC) development and adverse radiotherapy responses. Sixteen ATM variants were genotyped in 254 BC cases, 70 of whom were adverse radiotherapy responders (RS-BC), and 312 control subjects and the ATM haplotypes were constructed. Constitutive ATM protein, cell survival, and the p53 response after exposure to ionizing radiation were compared in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from the BC cases, AT, and normal individuals. The tightly linked intronic ATM polymorphisms IVS22-77 T>C and IVS48 + 238 C>G, in the homozygote state were associated with increased BC risk [IVS22-77 CC versus TT odds ratio (OR), 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00-2.81], and in the heterozygote state with clinical radioprotection (IVS22-77 CT versus TT OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24-0.85). Homozygote carriers of the G5557A variant were over-represented in RS-BC cases compared with non-RS-BC cases (OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 1.19-38.43). These three single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with the three major ATM haplotypes present in >80% of the study population. BC LCLs treated with ionizing radiation exhibited an intermediate cell survival and p53 response between that of normal and AT LCLs, with the response in the RS-BC LCLs being more compromised than in the non-RS-BC LCLs. Our study suggests a general pattern of increased BC risk associated with carrying any one of the ATM variants studied, with a significant association being observed in individuals carrying variants on both ATM alleles (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.09-2.81) and that ATM variants may impact on radiation sensitivity.

The patients were only included when median reference dose was 55Gy (range 54-55Gy) given with either 1.8-2Gy per fraction five times per week (27 patients) or 2.5Gy four times per week (42 patients); 23 patients were given tamoxifen and 8 patients were given chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To examine the association of polymorphisms in ATM (codon 158), GSTP1 (codon 105), SOD2 (codon 16), TGFB1 (position -509), XPD (codon 751), and XRCC1 (codon 399) with fibrosis and also individual radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis with 69 breast cancer patients treated with breast-conserving radiotherapy; total dose delivered was restricted to vary between 54 and 55Gy. Fibrosis was evaluated according to LENT/SOMA score. DNA was extracted from blood samples; cellular radiosensitivity was measured using the G0 assay and polymorphisms by PCR-RFLP and MALDI-TOF, respectively. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of all patients developed fibrosis of grade 2 or 3. This proportion tends to be higher in patients being polymorphic in TGFB1 or XRCC1 when compared to patients with wildtype genotype, whereas for ATM, GSTP1, SOD2 and XPD the polymorphic genotype appears to be associated with a lower risk of fibrosis. However, none of these associations are significant. In contrast, when a risk score is calculated based on all risk alleles, there was significant association with an increased risk of fibrosis (per risk allele odds ratio (ORs)=2.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32-3.55, p=0.0005). All six polymorphisms were found to have no significant effect on cellular radiosensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: It is most likely that risk for radiation-induced fibrosis can be assessed by a combination of risk alleles. This finding needs to be replicated in further studies.

42	Potentially functional variants of p14ARF are associated with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients and survival after definitive chemoradiotherapy	English	2014	24104554	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24104554	Journal Article	Non-Hispanic White; Other	552	469	83	\N	\N	\N	All patients included in survival analyses were treated with definitive chemoradiation for curative intent at our institution.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Since p14 (ARF) and human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 E6/E7 oncoproteins are important regulators participating in the p53/Rb pathways, genetic variations of p14 (ARF) may modify tumor HPV16 status and survival of HPV16-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) patients. We determined tumor HPV16 status and expression of p14/p53 and genotyped p14 (ARF) -rs3731217 and -rs3088440 polymorphisms in 552 incident SCCOP patients. We found that patients having variant genotypes for each p14 (ARF) polymorphism were approximately two or three times as likely to have HPV16-positive tumors compared with patients with corresponding common homozygous genotype, and such an association was particularly pronounced in patients with variant genotypes of both polymorphisms. After definitive chemoradiotherapy, patients having p14 (ARF) rs3731217 TG/GG variant genotypes had significantly better overall, disease-specific and disease-free survival than those having TT genotype, respectively. Multivariable analysis found that patients with p14 (ARF) -rs3731217 TT genotype had an ~7-, 11- and 3-fold increased risk for death overall, death due to SCCOP and recurrence than those with TG/GG variant genotypes, respectively. Furthermore, such significantly prognostic effect was also found when survival analysis was limited to HPV16-positive patients. Additionally, potentially functional relevance of the two variants was characterized to explore the genotype-phenotype correlation. Our findings indicate p14 (ARF) variants may predict tumor HPV16-positive SCCOP patients and survival.	Carcinogenesis	Stage I-II: 40 patients, Stage III-IV: 512 patients.

The treatment was performed using a daily dose of two Grays and high-energy photons (15 MV) to obtain deeper penetration and better dose uniformity.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between ATM, TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms in prostate cancer patients and morbidity after radiotherapy. The presence of ATM (rs1801516), TP53 (rs1042522, rs1800371, rs17878362, rs17883323, and rs35117667), and MDM2 (rs2279744) polymorphisms was assessed by direct sequencing of PCR fragments from 48 patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma and treated with external beam radiation. The side effects were classified according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score. The results showed no association between clinical characteristics and the development of radiation toxicities (P > 0.05). The C>T transition in the position 16273 (intron 3) of TP53 (rs35117667) was significantly associated with the risk of acute skin toxicity (OR: 0.0072, 95% CI 0.0002-0.227, P = 0.003). The intronic TP53 polymorphism at position 16250 (rs17883323) was associated with chronic urinary toxicity (OR: 0.071, 95%CI 0.006-0.784, P = 0.032). No significant associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms (P > 0.05). The results show that clinical characteristics were not determinant on the developing of radiation sensitivity in prostate cancer patients, and intronic TP53 polymorphisms would be associated with increased acute and chronic radiation toxicities. These observations corroborate the importance of investigating the genetic profile to predict adverse side effects in patients undergoing radiotherapy.	Disease Markers	\N
44	Glutathione S-transferase P1 single nucleotide polymorphism predicts permanent ototoxicity in children with medulloblastoma	English	2013	23065688	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23065688	Journal Article	\N	69	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes are involved in detoxifying chemotherapy and clearing reactive oxygen species formed by radiation. We explored the relationship between the host GSTP1 105 A > G polymorphism (rs1695), tumor GSTpi protein expression, and clinical outcomes in pediatric medulloblastoma. We hypothesized that the GSTP1 105 G-allele and increased tumor GSTpi expression would be associated with lower progression-free survival and fewer adverse events. PROCEDURE: The study included 106 medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) patients seen at Texas Children's Cancer Center. Genotyping was performed using an Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip and GSTpi expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. We used the Kaplan-Meier method for survival analyses and logistic regression for toxicity comparisons. RESULTS: Patients with a GSTP1 105 AG/GG genotype (vs. AA) or who had received high dose craniospinal radiation (≥34 Gy vs. <26 Gy) had a greater risk of requiring hearing aids than their counterparts (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.2-13.6, and OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.1-8.8, respectively, n = 69). Additionally, there was a statistically significant interaction between these variables. Compared with the lowest risk group (GSTP1 105 AA-low dose radiation), patients with a GSTP1 105 AG/GG genotype who received high dose radiation were 8.4 times more likely to require hearing aids (95% CI 1.4-49.9, p-trend = 0.005, n = 69). When adjusted for age, cumulative cisplatin dose, and amifostine use, the association remained. CONCLUSIONS: The GSTP1 105 G-allele is associated with permanent ototoxicity in pediatric medulloblastoma/PNET and strongly interacts with radiation dose. Patients with this allele should be considered for clinical trials employing radiation dose modifications and cytoprotectant strategies.	Pediatric Blood & Cancer	\N

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To study associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in Ribonuclease L (RNASEL), a gene implicated in inflammation and prostate cancer risk, and outcomes after radiation therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We followed participants in the prospective US Health Professionals Follow-Up Study treated with radiation therapy for early-stage prostate cancer. Three SNPs were genotyped based on previously determined functional and biological significance. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to assess per-allele associations with the primary outcome defined as time to a composite endpoint including development of lethal prostate cancer or biochemical recurrence. RESULTS: We followed 434 patients treated with radiation therapy for a median of 9 years. On multivariate analysis, the rs12757998 variant allele was associated with significantly decreased risk of the composite endpoint [HR: 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.45-0.94%; P = 0.02] driven by decreased biochemical recurrence (HR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.89%; P = 0.01) and men treated with external beam (HR: 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.93%; P = 0.02). In contrast, in 516 men from the same cohort treated with radical prostatectomy, we found no significant impact of this variant on outcome. Furthermore, the rs12757998 variant allele significantly modified the association between androgen deprivation therapy and outcomes after radiation therapy (p-interaction = 0.02). CONCLUSION: We show an association between RNASEL SNP rs12757998 and outcome after radiation therapy for prostate cancer. This SNP is associated with increased circulating C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, suggesting a potential role for inflammation in the response to radiation. If validated, genetic predictors of outcome may help inform prostate cancer management.	Clinical Cancer Research	T1-2: 418 patients, T3: 10 patients.

Exclusion criteria included the use of surgery, thoracic radiotherapy with a total dose of <20 Gy, non-platinum-based chemotherapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)/Zubrod performance status (PS) >2, and other primary malignancies. Curative radiotherapy was prescribed to 47 % (165/351) of patients in a good performance status with stage I–IIIB disease, while those with impaired performance status or stage IV disease received palliative treatment. Patients irradiated with curative intent received total doses of ≥60 Gy given in 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions for 5 days per week over 6–7 weeks, while 20 Gy in 4.0 Gy fractions or 30 Gy in 3.0 Gy fractions over 5-10 days was delivered to 186 (53 %) patients treated with palliative intent. Chemotherapy with platinum-based doublets was given to 235 (67 %) patients, either as an induction treatment before radiotherapy (146/235, 62 %) or as a part of palliative regimen (89/235, 38 %). In general, three to four chemotherapy cycles were most frequently prescribed (156/235, 66 %), the smaller number of chemotherapy courses was given to poor responders, while those with major responses received five to six courses. Cisplatin with vinorelbine was given to 74 % (173/235) of those who received chemotherapy, 29 (12 %) patients received cisplatin with etoposide, and 16 (7 %) individuals received cisplatin with gemcitabine. Carboplatin-based doublets were prescribed in ten cases (4 %), while seven (3 %) other individuals received platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed. EGFR mutations were not routinely tested in this series, and only one patient received tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We note that patients with adenocarcinoma represent only 18 % of all cases. Second-line chemotherapy (docetaxel monotherapy) was given to 50 (14 %) individuals.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Polymorphism in signal-induced proliferation-associated 1 (SIPA1) gene may contribute to the development of metastasis in human cancers. In this preliminary study, we examined the association of the SIPA1 -313A>G (rs931127) polymorphism with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in 351 inoperable patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy (curative or palliative). The GG homozygotes had significantly shorter PFS under codominant and recessive models in all patients (hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, p = 0.035, and HR 1.47, p = 0.022, respectively) and in advanced stage subgroup (HR 1.49, p = 0.037, and HR 1.48, p = 0.023, respectively). The GG genotype was also associated with reduced OS and PFS (codominant model: HR 2.41, p = 0.020, and HR 2.34, p = 0.020, respectively; recessive model: HR 2.16, p = 0.026, and HR 2.18, p = 0.022, respectively) in radiotherapy alone subgroup. Moreover, the SIPA1 -313GG was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for PFS in the cohort. Our results indicate, for the first time, that the SIPA1 -313A>G may have a prognostic role in unresected NSCLC making it a potential predictor of poor survival due to earlier progression.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a DNA-repair gene, X-Ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1), have been associated with the survival of patients with breast cancer. We investigated the predictive value of XRCC1 SNP (rs25487) in patients with early breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The XRCC1 rs25487 genotypes of 411 Finnish patients with breast cancer were analyzed by a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based method. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis according to the XRCC1 genotypes in specified adjuvant treatment groups. RESULTS: The rs25487 variant AA genotype was associated with worse breast cancer-specific and overall survival in 238 patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (p=0.031 and p=0.030, respectively).

49	A polymorphism in the DNA repair domain of APEX1 is associated with the radiation-induced pneumonitis risk among lung cancer patients after radiotherapy	English	2014	24884729	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24884729	Journal Article	\N	126	103	23	\N	\N	\N	A total of 48.4% of the patients received radiation plus chemotherapy, whereas the others received radiation only. The median total irradiation dose was 60 Gy (range, 30.0–70.6 Gy) given at 1.5–3.0 Gy per fraction. Three of the patients with lung cancer received only 30 Gy, because they could not continue treatment owing to their physical condition; other reasons included distant complications and accidents. Although they received only 30 Gy, one of them developed RP and two did not.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) (rs1130409, rs1760944, rs2307486 and rs3136817) in APEX1 with the risk of severe radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) after radiotherapy among Han Chinese patients with lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 168 patients with lung cancer who were receiving radiotherapy were prospectively recruited. RP was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. A case-control study was performed. The case group included patients with RP grade of ≥3, while the control group comprised patients with RP grades <3. Four tagSNPs of APEX1 were genotyped in 126 patients with complete follow-up by multi-SNaPshot® (Genesky Biotechnologies Inc., Shanghai, China) genotyping assays. RESULTS were assessed by a logistic regression model for RP risk and Mantal-Cox log-rank test for the cumulative RP probability by the genotypes. RESULTS: rs1130409 was associated with severe RP. GT genotype of rs1130409 was significantly higher in patients with RP than in those of the control group [68.8% vs 41.8%; p = 0.025; resulting odds ratio (OR), 5.98]. Patients with lung cancer bearing the G allele had a 5.83-fold higher risk of RP than those with the wild TT genotype [OR = 5.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.27-26.90; p = 0.024], and this was further confirmed by the binary regression adjusted by some confounding factors, including Karnofsky performance scale, concurrent chemotherapy-radiotherapy and lung volume receiving >30 Gy (OR = 6.96; 95% CI, 1.36-35.77; p = 0.02). rs1130409 was also associated with the time to occurrence of severe RP (p = 0.04). Three-dimensional model APEX1 protein showed that rs1130409 is located in the random coil structure corresponding to the DNA repair function region.

In using IMRT, the prescription doses were 70Gy/32-33Fs to primary tumor, 66-68Gy/32-33Fs to cervical nodular lesions, 60Gy/32-33Fs to involved cervical drainage regions, and 54Gy/32-33Fs to uninvolved cervical drainage regions. All radiotherapies were delivered once daily, 5 days weekly.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the 194 and 399 codons of XRCC1, and the risk of severe acute skin and oral mucosa reactions in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients in China. METHODS: 114 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were sequentially recruited in this study. Heparinized peripheral blood samples were taken for SNPs analysis before the start of radiation treatment. SNPs in XRCC1 (194Arg/Trp and 399Arg/Gln) gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Dermatitis at upper neck and oral mucositis were clinically recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.3.0. RESULTS: The variant allele frequencies were 0.289 for XRCC1 194Trp and 0.263 for XRCC1 399Gln. Of the 114 patients, 24 experienced grade 3 acute dermatitis and 48 had grade 3 acute mucositis. The XRCC1 399Arg/Gln was significantly associated with the development of grade 3 dermatitis (Odds Ratio, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.04-6.73; p = 0.037, χ2 = 4.357). In addition, it was also associated with higher incidence of grade 3 mucositis with a borderline statistical significance (Odds Ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 0.951-4.66; p = 0.065, χ2 = 3.411). The relationship between XRCC1 194Arg/Trp and acute dermatitis, and mucositis was not found. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation shows, for the first time, that patients with the XRCC1 399Arg/Gln genotype were more likely to experience severe acute dermatitis and oral mucositis. With further validation, the information can be used to determine personalized radiotherapy strategy.	Radiation Oncology	Stage II: 13 patients, Stage III: 46 patients, Stage IV: 55 patients.
51	The hMLH1 −93G>A Promoter Polymorphism is Associates with Outcomes in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients	English	2014	25047469	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25047469	Journal Article	\N	114	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	In this study, 114 patients had received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy.  Among these patients, 95 were advanced stage (pathologic TNM stage III+IV) and 19 were poorly differentiated pT1-2N0 OSCC tumors combined with pathologic tumor thickness ≥4 mm. Radiotherapy was scheduled within 4–6 weeks after surgical resection and administered five times a week at a dose of 1.8 or 2 Gy/fraction, using a 6 MV linear accelerator. The planning dose was 60 Gy to the surgical bed and upper neck, and 66 Gy to positive surgical margins. For advanced stage, the lower neck was also irradiated with a dose of 50 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of hMLH1 polymorphisms on treatment outcomes in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). METHODS: Genotypings were performed by direct DNA sequencing in peripheral blood leukocytes from 185 male OSCC patients. Patients received primary surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy. Two hMLH1 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-rs1800734 (-93G>A in the promoter) and rs1540354 (in the third intron)-were chosen from the HapMap project. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared between different genotypes. RESULTS: The hMLH1 rs1800734 and rs1540354 polymorphisms were in weak linkage disequilibrium (r (2) = 0.456). OSCC patients with the rs1800734 AA genotype had a significantly poor prognosis in both OS and DFS. This SNP can also predict the outcomes of OSCC patients with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, especially in advanced stage; however, no significant differences in patient outcomes were found for the hMLH1 rs1540354 genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the hMLH1 -93G>A SNP is found to be associated with patient outcomes in OSCC. This SNP can also predict their treatment outcome of radiotherapy.

Of all patients, 20 patients received radiation only, 175 received radiation in combination with chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is a pathway that repairs DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to maintain genomic stability in response to irradiation. The authors hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NHEJ repair genes may affect clinical outcomes in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who receive definitive radio(chemo)therapy. METHODS: The authors genotyped 5 potentially functional SNPs-x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 4 (XRCC4) reference SNP (rs) number rs6869366 (-1394 guanine to thymine [-1394G→T] change) and rs28360071 (intron 3, deletion/insertion), XRCC5 rs3835 (guanine to adenine [G→A] change at nucleotide 2408), XRCC6 rs2267437 (-1310 cytosine to guanine [C→G) change], and DNA ligase IV (LIG4) rs1805388 (threonine-to-isoleucine change at codon 9 [T9I])-and estimated their associations with severe radiation pneumonitis (RP) (grade ≥3) in 195 patients with NSCLC. RESULTS: A predictive role in radiation pneumonitis (RP) development was observed for the LIG4 SNP rs1805388 (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-4.12; P = .037 for the CT/TT genotype vs the CC genotype). In addition, men with the TT genotype of the XRCC4 rs6869366 SNP and women with AG + AA genotypes of the XRCC5 rs3835 SNP also were at increased risk of developing severe RP. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that NHEJ genetic polymorphisms, particularly LIG4 rs1805388, may modulate the risk of RP in patients with NSCLC who receive definitive radio(chemo)therapy. Large studies will be needed to confirm these findings.	Cancer	Stage I-II: 29 patients, Stage III-IV: 166 patients.

Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The aims of this study were to analyze the polymorphisms XRCC1 Arg194Trp, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC3 Thr241Met, XPC Lys939Gln, ERCC1 Asn118Asn, and RAD51 -98G>C and to verify their influence on radiotherapy response and prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Peripheral blood DNA was extracted from 311 patients and analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Our results showed that in irradiated oral and oropharyngeal patients, the 939Gln allele increased 6-fold local disease relapse risk (OR = 6.04; CI = 1.47-24.88) and over 2-fold the earliness of relapse (HR = 2.63; CI = 1.04-6.70). As for the XRCC3 polymorphism, multivariate analysis showed that the 241Met allele increases over 33-fold local relapse risk (OR = 33.64; CI = 3.23-350.85), over 12-fold earliness of relapse (HR = 12.55; CI = 2.47-63.73) and over 3-fold earliness of death (HR = 3.04; CI = 1.08-8.61). For polymorphism RAD51 -98, multivariate analysis showed that allele C increases over 3-fold the risk of relapse (OR = 3.13; CI = 1.12-8.78) and over 2-fold the earliness of relapse (HR = 2.84; CI = 1.25-6.47). For polymorphism XRCC1 Arg399Gln, multivariate analysis showed that the 399Gln allele increased the risk of local disease relapse for irradiated oral and oropharyngeal patients (OR = 3.35; CI = 1.10-10.13) by over 3-fold. Based on these results, we suggest that these polymorphisms may be useful markers of prognosis in HNSCC.	Genetics and Molecular Research	\N
53	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of the transforming growth factor-beta1 gene and overall survival in unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with radio(chemo)therapy in a Chinese population	English	2013	23435990	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23435990	Journal Article	Chinese	109	87	22	63	\N	[35.0,79.0)	All patients were treated with definitive conventional or three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with or without platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The outcome is variable for unresectable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ULANSCLC) patients treated with radio(chemo)therapy. The aim of this study is to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) gene are associated with overall survival (OS) in ULANSCLC patients treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy. A total of 109 patients who had available blood samples and complete clinical and follow-up information were enrolled. DNA from blood was genotyped for two SNPs: TGF-β1 C-509T and T+869C. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, and Cox's proportional hazard model were used to evaluate associations between genotypes and OS. Log-rank test showed that TGF-β1 C-509T significantly correlated with OS (pooled P = 0.017). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TGF-β1 C-509T CC genotype was significantly associated with better OS than CT or TT genotypes. These results indicate that TGF-β1 C-509T CC genotype is significantly associated with better OS in ULANSCLC patients treated with radio(chemo)therapy as a potential independent survival predictor.

54	Impact of CCND1 A870G polymorphism on acute adverse events in postoperative rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy	Chinese	2013	23985254	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23985254	Journal Article	\N	400	246	154	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of CCND1 A870G and acute adverse events (AEs) in postoperative rectal cancer patients who received capecitabine-based postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: Four hundred patients with stage II and III rectal cancer received postoperative CRT of capecitabine with or without oxaliplatin were accumulated and prostectively studied in this study. The patients were randomly divided into two groups. Two hundred and twenty-eight patients were treated with concurrent capecitabine and radiotherapy (Cap-CRT), and 172 patients were treated with capecitabine and oxaliplatin plus radiotherapy (Cap-Oxa-CRT). Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v. 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0). The genotype of CCND1 A870G in the patients was detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. The associations between the SNP and acute AEs were indicated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were computed with logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients presented severe AEs. Among them the frequencies of the three genotypes GG, GA and AA were 16.9%, 50.7% and 32.4%, compared with 24.6%, 48.1% and 27.3%, respectively, among the patients without severe AEs. Diarrhea was the most common AE, and severe diarrhea occurred in 109 patients. The frequencies of the three genotypes GG, GA and AA were 15.6%, 47.7% and 36.7% among these patients, compared with 24.4%, 49.5% and 26.1%, respectively, among patients without severe diarrhea. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a 1.66-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea in patients with AA genotype (95%CI 1.03 - 2.67, P = 0.038) compared with the cases with GG or GA genotypes. Stratified analysis showed that in the Cap-Oxa-CRT group, patients with AA genotype showed a 2.34-fold increased risk for severe diarrhea (95%CI 1.16 - 4.76, P = 0.018) compared with those with GG or GA genotypes, but in the Cap-CRT group, the SNP was not associated with the risk of severe diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphism of CCND1 A870G might be a potential biomarker for predicting acute AEs in postoperative stage II and III rectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy of capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

Therapies received by this cohort included induction chemotherapy followed by radiation (n = 15), induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (n = 48), and upfront concurrent chemotherapy and radiation without induction treatment (n = 84). Seventeen patients were treated with radiation only.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: In search of reliable biologic markers to predict the risk of normal tissue damage by radio(chemo)therapy before treatment, we investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transforming growth factor 1 (TGFbeta1) gene and risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using 164 available genomic DNA samples from patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy, we genotyped three SNPs of the TGFbeta1 gene (rs1800469:C-509T, rs1800471:G915C, and rs1982073:T869C) by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. We used Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability to assess the risk of grade > or = 3 RP and Cox proportional hazards analyses to evaluate the effect of TGFbeta1 genotypes on such risk. RESULTS: There were 90 men and 74 women in the study, with median age of 63 years. Radiation doses ranging from 60 to 70 Gy (median = 63 Gy) in 30 to 58 fractions were given to 158 patients (96.3%) and platinum-based chemotherapy to 147 (89.6%). Grade > or = 2 and grade > or = 3 RP were observed in 74 (45.1%) and 36 patients (22.0%), respectively. Multivariate analysis found CT/CC genotypes of TGFbeta1 rs1982073:T869C to be associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of RP grades > or = 2 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.489; 95% CI, 0.227 to 0.861; P = .013) and grades > or = 3 (HR = 0.390; 95% CI, 0.197 to .774; P = 0.007), respectively, compared with the TT genotype, after adjustment for Karnofsky performance status, smoking status, pulmonary function, and dosimetric parameters. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that CT/CC genotypes of TGFbeta1 rs1982073:T869C gene were associated with lower risk of RP in patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy and thus may serve as a reliable predictor of RP.

Patients with locally advanced inoperable/metastatic disease received chemotherapy, first in the form of gemcitabine (1 g/㎡ -days 1 and 8) along with cisplatin (25 mg/㎡ days 1 and 8), or oxaliplatin (130 mg/㎡ day 1) in patients with compromised renal function, repeated at 3-weekly intervals, or oral capecitabine (1650 mg/㎡ days 1–14 at 3-weekly intervals) or intravenously injected 5-FU 370 mg/㎡ days 1–5 at 4-weekly intervals to a total of six cycles. The clinical response assessment was conducted after completion of three and six cycles of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: miR-27a, miR-181a, and miR-570 genetic variants have been found to play an important role in many cancers, but their contribution in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) has not been explored. Therefore, we investigated the role of these micro RNA (miRNA) genetic variants in terms of GBC susceptibility, therapeutic response, toxicities associated with chemo-radiotherapy and survival outcome. METHODS: This study included 606 GBC patients and 200 healthy controls. From among the larger study cohort, 219 patients receiving adjuvant or palliative chemo-radiotherapy as per disease status were followed up for toxicity profile. Treatment response was recorded in 159 patients who received palliative chemo-radiotherapy. Genotypes were determined using allelic discrimination assay. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS version 16. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) analysis was performed for gene-gene interactions. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression tests. RESULTS: In univariate logistic regression analysis, no association with any of the studied polymorphisms was found in overall GBC susceptibility. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no significant association with response to chemo-radiotherapy. In GMDR analysis, miR-27ars895819, miR-570rs4143815, and miR-181ars12537 combination was found as the best gene-gene interaction model for susceptibility and treatment response. Furthermore, miR-27ars895819miR-181ars12537 was associated with neutropenia toxicity in patients undergoing chemo-radiotherapy. However, miRNA variants had no influence over the survival outcomes of GBC patients (locally advanced, metastatic). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the miRNA variants cumulatively influence GBC susceptibility and treatment outcomes.

56	XRCC1 gene polymorphism for prediction of response and prognosis in the multimodality therapy of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2010	20863523	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20863523	Journal Article	\N	81	51	30	59	\N	\N	All patients received a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (50.4 Gy, 5-FU) followed by surgical therapy. Restaging was done 2 to 3 wk following completion of radiochemotherapy, and surgical therapy was performed in all study patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant treatment strategies have been developed to improve survival of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Since mainly patients with major histopathologic response benefit from this therapy, predictive markers are needed. The gene polymorphism of the X-ray-repair-cross complementing (XRCC1-) gene (rs25487) was analyzed to predict response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and prognosis in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 81 patients (51 male; 30 female; median age 59 years) with locally advanced rectal cancer were included in this study. All patients received a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (50.4 Gy, 5-FU) followed by surgical therapy. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major response when resected specimens contained less than 10% viable tumor cells (n = 28) and minor response when more than 10% viable tumor cells (n = 53) were detected in the surgical specimen. Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues of all study patients. Allelic discrimination was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Two allele-specific TaqMan probes in competition were used for amplification of the XRCC1 gene. Allelic genotyping was correlated with therapy response and prognosis. RESULTS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism XRCC1 A399G (rs25487) was predictive for therapy response (P = 0.039). Within the AG genotype group, 17 (53%) patients showed a minor response and 15 (47%) patients a major response. In contrast, 39 (78%) of the patients with homogeneous AA or GG genotype were minor responders and only 11 (22%) major responders. No prognostic value was revealed for the XRCC1 A399G (rs25487) gene polymorphism in the multimodality therapy. CONCLUSION: Our data supports the role of XRCC1 as a predictive marker for therapy response in the multimodality therapy of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Single-nucleotide polymorphism XRCC1 A399G (rs25487) could be applied to individualize treatment strategies.

57	The VEGFR2, COX-2 and MMP-2 polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome of patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer	English	2015	25975224	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25975224	Journal Article	Caucasian	350	239	111	\N	\N	\N	All patients received an external beam radiotherapy with a total dose ≥ 20 Gy. Patients treated with curative intent with doses ≥ 60 Gy (47%) had treatment 5 days per week with fraction doses of 1.8–2.0 Gy given over 6–7 weeks. Patients treated with palliative intent (53%) received 20 Gy in 4.0 Gy fractions or 30 Gy in 3.0 Gy fractions over 5–10 days. Curative radiotherapy was prescribed to the patients in a good performance status with Stage I–IIIB disease, while others received palliative treatment. A total of 235 (67%) patients received also 1–6 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin/carboplatin with vinorelbine, etoposide, gemcitabine or pemetrexed), either as induction treatment before radiotherapy (n=146) or as a part of palliative regimen (n=89).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Certain common inherited variations in genes involved in tumor angiogenesis, progression and metastasis may contribute to cancer therapy outcome and prognosis by altering the gene expression and protein activity. In this report, we examined the effect of functional polymorphisms in MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, VEGF, VEGFR2, FGFR4 and COX-2 genes on overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of 350 Caucasian patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The results of multivariate analysis indicated that VEGFR2 -906C and COX-2 -1195G alleles were strongly associated with poor OS and PFS (p = 0.002 and 0.015, respectively, for OS; p = 0.009 and 0.015, respectively, for PFS), while MMP-2 -1306 T allele carriers had significantly reduced PFS (p = 0.010). Moreover, an increased risk of death and progression was significantly associated with the number of adverse alleles for VEGFR2/COX-2 (p = 0.0005 for OS and 0.0006 for PFS in >1 adverse allele carriers) and VEGFR2/COX-2/MMP-2 combinations (p = 0.0003 for OS and 0.0001 for PFS in patients with >2 adverse alleles). Finally, VEGFR2 TC/CC, COX-2 AG/GG and MMP-2 CT/TT genotypes as well as "at risk" allele combinations were identified as independent predictors of unfavorable OS and PFS in the group. In conclusion, the data suggest that selected VEGFR2, COX-2 and MMP-2 polymorphisms may be potential prognostic markers in unresectable NSCLC treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy, although further validation studies are warranted to confirm our observations.

58	Pharmacogenetic Analysis of INT 0144 Trial: Association of Polymorphisms with Survival and Toxicity in Rectal Cancer Patients Treated with 5-FU and Radiation	English	2015	25589620	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589620	Journal Article	White; Non-White	746	479	267	61	\N	[19.0,86.0)	Patients were randomly allocated to one of three chemotherapy regimens and stratified according to nodal involvement, type of surgery, primary tumor stage, and time from surgery to registration. Arm 1 consisted of induction bolus 5-FU followed by combined 5-FU PVI and radiation. Bolus 5-FU was then administered for two cycles. Arm 2 consisted of induction 5-FU PVI followed by combined 5-FU PVI and radiation. Additional 5-FU PVI was given after completion of radiation. Arm 3 consisted of induction bolus 5-FU, leucovorin (LV) and levamisole. Radiation was combined with bolus 5-FU and LV. Patients then received additional bolus 5-FU, LV and levamisole. Radiation consisted in 45 Gy in single daily 1.8 Gy fractions followed by a boost volume of 5.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy fractions.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: We tested whether 18 polymorphisms in 16 genes (GSTP1, COX2, IL10, EGFR, EGF, FGFR4, CCDN1, VEGFR2, VEGF, CXCR2, IL8, MMP3, ICAM1, ERCC1, RAD51, and XRCC3) would predict disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity in the INT0144 trial, which was designed to investigate different postoperative regimens of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancers: Arm 1 consisted of bolus 5-FU followed by 5-FU protracted venous infusion (PVI) with radiotherapy; arm 2 was induction and concomitant PVI 5-FU with radiotherapy and arm 3 was induction and concomitant bolus 5-FU with radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA from 746 stage II/III rectal patients enrolled in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9304 phase III trial was analyzed. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The polymorphisms were analyzed using direct DNA-sequencing or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: GSTP1-Ile105Val (rs1695) was significantly associated with DFS and OS and its effect did not vary by treatment arm. The five-year DFS and OS were 53% and 58%, respectively, for G/G, 66% and 72% for G/A, and 57% and 66% for A/A patients. In arm 2, IL8-251A/A genotype (rs4073) was associated with a lower risk of toxicities (P = 0.04). The VEGFR2 H472Q Q/Q genotype (rs1870377) was associated with a higher risk of grade 3-5 proximal upper gastrointestinal tract (PUGIT) mucositis (P = 0.04) in arm 2. However, in arm 1, this genotype was associated with a lower risk of PUGIT mucositis (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: rs1695 may be prognostic in patients with rectal cancer treated with adjuvant CRT. rs4073 and rs1870377 may exhibit different associations with toxicity, according to the 5-FU schedule.

59	Single nucleotide polymorphisms of RecQ1, RAD54L, and ATM genes are associated with reduced survival of pancreatic cancer	English	2006	16520463	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16520463	Journal Article	White; Hispanic; Black; Other	92	52	40	65	\N	[38.0,83.0)	All patients were treated with neoadjuvant concurrent gemcitabine and radiotherapy with or without a component of induction gemcitabine/ cisplatin at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) from February 1999 to August 2004 and observed through August 2005. Patients in the ID98-020 trial (n = 43) had received gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy consisting of weekly gemcitabine (400 mg/㎡) for 4 weeks and radiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 weeks. Patients in the ID01-341 trial (n = 49) had received induction therapy of gemcitabine (750 mg/㎡/d) and cisplatin (30 mg/㎡/d) every 2 weeks for 4 weeks, followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly gemcitabine (400 mg/㎡) for 4 weeks and radiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 weeks.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Our goal was to determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes influence the clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 13 SNPs of eight DNA damage response and repair genes in 92 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. All patients were treated with neoadjuvant concurrent gemcitabine and radiotherapy with or without a component of induction gemcitabine/cisplatin at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) from February 1999 to August 2004 and observed through August 2005. Response to the pretreatment was assessed by evaluating time to tumor progression and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox regression were used to compare survival of patients according to genotype. RESULTS: The RecQ1 A159C, RAD54L C157T, XRCC1 R194W, and ATM T77C genotypes had a significant effect on the overall survival with log-rank P values of .001, .004, .001, and .02, respectively. A strong combined effect of the four genotypes was observed. Patients with none of the adverse genotypes had a mean survival time of 62.1 months, and those with one, two, or three or more at-risk alleles had median survival times of 27.5, 14.4, and 9.9 months, respectively (log-rank P < .001). There is a significant interaction between the RecQ1 gene and other genotypes. All four genes except XRCC1 remained as independent predictors of survival in multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for other clinical predictors. CONCLUSION: These observations support the hypothesis that polymorphic variants of DNA repair genes affect clinical prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	\N
60	Association of genetic variants in VEGF-A with clinical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy	English	2014	24435801	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435801	Journal Article	\N	496	496	\N	\N	\N	\N	All patients underwent definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer with curative intent. The clinical target volume included the entire prostate and the base of the seminal vesicles (SV). A safety margin of 10 mm was added in all directions to create the planning target volume (PTV). The rectum was contoured from the sigmoid flexure to the anal verge, the bladder as a single solid organ. High energy photons (18 MV) were delivered in a three-field technique using an anterior and two lateral fields to encompass the PTV. At the time of this study, the total dose prescribed to the ICRU reference point was 70 Gy delivered in 2 Gy per fraction (5 ×/week). None of the included patients received pelvic node irradiation.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), a key regulator of tumor-induced angiogenesis, is critical for tumor growth and metastasization. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value of VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes for clinical recurrence after definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The association of seven VEGF-A polymorphisms and their haplotypes with clinical recurrence (defined as the occurrence of local recurrence and/or distant metastases) in 496 prostate cancer patients treated with definitive radiotherapy were investigated. Genotypes were determined by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays; haplotypes were analyzed using the Haploview program. RESULTS: Within a median follow-up time of 80 months, 44 patients (9 %) developed clinical recurrences. Haplotype analysis showed two separate blocks of high-linkage disequilibrium, formed by five polymorphisms (- 2578C > A, - 2489C > T, - 1498C > T, - 634G > C, - 7C > T) upstream of the coding sequence (CCCCC, ATTGC, CCCGC, ATTGT) and two polymorphisms (936C > T, 1612G > A) downstream of the coding sequence (CA, CG, TG). Carriers of at least 1 copy of the ATTGC haplotype were at higher risk of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 3.83; 95 %CI 1.48-9.90, p = 0.006); for carriers of 2 copies, the HR was 4.85 (95 %CI 1.72-13.6; p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, patients harboring at least one copy of the ATTGC haplotype remained at increased risk of recurrence (HR 3.63, 95 %CI 1.38-9.55, p = 0.009); in patients carrying 2 copies, the HR was 4.72 (95 %CI 1.64-13.6, p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the VEGF-A ATTGC haplotype may predict clinical recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.	Strahlentherapie und Onkologie	\N
61	A study of ethnic differences in TGFβ1 gene polymorphisms and effects on the risk of radiation pneumonitis in non-small-cell lung cancer	English	2012	23059779	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23059779	Journal Article	\N	167	125	42	\N	58	\N	A treatment-planning computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, using intravenous contrast if the patient was not allergic to contrast agent. CT scans with slices 5-mm thick were obtained from the mandible to the lower edge of the liver. Lung dose–volume histograms were computed from the three-dimensional dose distributions. Dosimetric data, including MLD, volume of normal lung receiving 5 Gy or more radiation (V5), and volume of normal lung receiving 20 Gy or more radiation (V20), were available for all 167 patients. The median total radiation dose was 56 Gy once daily, receiving 1.8 to 2.0 Gy per fraction to 54 to 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks using a 6-MV photon linear accelerator; 15 patients (15 of 167, 9.0%) were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy using 6 to 7 Gy/fraction per day to 60 to 70 Gy/10 fractions.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: To investigate whether Chinese non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) (grade ≥ 3) caused by radiotherapy display reliable single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker(s) located on the transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGFβ1) gene. METHODS: DNA was isolated from blood samples obtained from NSCLC patients (n = 167) treated with radiotherapy alone (n = 23) or chemoradiation (n = 144) with the median total radiation dose of 56 Gy between 2007 and 2010. A comprehensive approach toward characterizing the TGFβ1 SNPs in Chinese patients was carried out in this study. Eight SNPs of the TGFβ1 gene (rs1800469, rs1800471, rs1982073, rs4803455, rs11466345, rs12983047, rs10417924, and rs10980942) were finally genotyped by the direct DNA sequencing method. Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability was used to assess the risk of RP of grade 3 or higher. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to evaluate the effect of TGFβ1 genotypes on RP risk. RESULTS: A total of 46 patients (27.5%) developed RP of grade 3 or higher, based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, with a median follow-up of 29.5 months (range, 16-58). The rs1982073 SNP, associated with RP risk in whites, was not found to be associated with the risk of RP of grade 3 or higher in Chinese NSCLC patients. Multivariate analysis found AG/GG genotypes of the novel TGFβ1 SNP rs11466345 to be associated with a significantly higher risk of RP of grade 3 or higher compared with the AA genotypes, after adjustment for age, smoking status, and dosimetric parameters (for mean lung dose, adjusted hazards ratio = 2.295, 95% confidence interval: 1.101-4.783, p = 0.027; for volume of normal lung receiving 20 GY or more radiation, adjusted hazards ratio = 2.142, 95% confidence interval: 1.033-4.441, p = 0.041). CONCLUSION: The AG/GG genotypes of novel TGFβ1 rs11466345 were associated with a higher risk of RP in Chinese NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. The rs1982073 SNP, associated with RP risk in whites, was not correlated with higher RP risk in the Chinese patients studied. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings in different ethnic populations.

74	Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus: ERCC1 gene polymorphisms for prediction of response and prognosis	English	2012	21956434	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21956434	Journal Article	\N	153	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Briefly, cisplatin (20 mg/㎡/day) was administered as a short-term infusion on days 1–5 and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (1,000 mg/㎡/day) as a continuous infusion over 24 h on days 1–5. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 36 Gy using a multiple field technique. Standardized transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy was performed 4–5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RT/CTx) regimens were primarily designed for treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Own preliminary results demonstrate that also patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus may achieve a major response in 30% with a 3-year survival rate of 80%. To identify these patients, ERCC1 (rs11615) gene polymorphisms were analyzed. ERCC1 is a key enzyme of the nucleotide excision and repair (NER) complex to prevent DNA inter- and intra-strand crosslinks. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA from 217 patients with cT3/4 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues. Of these patients, 153 underwent neoadjuvant RT/CTx (CDDP, 5-FU, 36 Gy). For analysis of ERCC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), allelic discrimination was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Two allele-specific TaqMan probes in competition were used for amplification of ERCC1 (rs11615). Allelic genotyping was correlated with histomorphologic tumor regression after neoadjuvant RT/CTx and survival. Major response (MaHR) was defined as <10% vital residual tumor cells (VRTC). RESULTS: Analysis of tumor regression revealed a MaHR in 56/153 (36.6%) patients with a 5-year survival rate (5-YSR) of 74% (p < 0.001). ERCC1 gene polymorphisms for all patients showed the following expression pattern: ERCC1 polymorphism (rs11615) CC: n = 27 (12.4%), TT: n = 98 (45.2%), C/T: n = 92 (42.4%). ERCC1 polymorphism CT was identified as a predictor for response to the neoadjuvant RT/CTx (p < 0.001). The 5-YSR for patients with C/T genotype was 51%. Contrary to this, the 5-YSR for the group of patients with a CC/TT polymorphism decreased to 34%. CONCLUSION: Analysis of ERCC1 (rs11615) gene polymorphisms reveals a significant correlation with response and survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus treated with a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of ERCC1 (rs11615) could therefore be applied to further individualize therapy in esophageal cancer.	Journal of Gastrointestinal Surgery	\N
62	Next-generation sequencing identifies germline MRE11A variants as markers of radiotherapy outcomes in muscle-invasive bladder cancer	English	2014	24623370	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623370	Journal Article	\N	186	139	47	79	\N	[55.0,93.0)	Using three-dimensional conformal external beam RT (52.5–55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) can be cured by radical radiotherapy (RT). We previously found tumour MRE11 expression to be predictive of survival following RT in MIBC, and this was independently validated in a separate institute. Here, we investigated germline MRE11A variants as possible predictors of RT outcomes in MIBC, using next-generation sequencing (NGS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The MRE11A gene was amplified in germline DNA from 186 prospectively recruited MIBC patients treated with RT and sequenced using bar-coded multiplexed NGS. Germline variants were analysed for associations with cancer-specific survival (CSS). For validation as a prognostic or predictive marker, rs1805363 was then genotyped in a cystectomy-treated MIBC cohort of 256 individuals. MRE11A mRNA isoform expression was measured in bladder cancer cell lines and primary tumour samples. RESULTS: Carriage of at least one of six (five novel) rare variants was associated with the worse RT outcome (hazard ratio [HR] 4.04, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.42-11.51, P = 0.009). The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1805363 (minor allele frequency 11%), was also associated with worse CSS (per-allele HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.34-3.28, Ptrend = 0.001) following RT in MIBC, with a gene-dosage effect observed, but no effect seen on CSS in the cystectomy cohort (Ptrend = 0.89). Furthermore, rs1805363 influenced relative MRE11A isoform expression, with increased isoform 2 expression with carriage of the rs1805363 minor A allele. CONCLUSIONS: Germline MRE11A SNP rs1805363 was predictive of RT, but not of cystectomy outcome in MIBC. If successfully validated in an independent RT-treated cohort, this SNP could be a useful clinical tool for selecting patients for bladder-conserving treatment.

63	Associations of ATM Polymorphisms With Survival in Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy	English	2015	26094126	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094126	Journal Article	\N	412	303	85	\N	\N	\N	Among 412 patients in the first set, 266 received radiation therapy alone, and 146 received concurrent chemoradiation therapy; the latter were administrated first-line chemotherapy regimens including platinum drugs (cisplatin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil); cisplatin was administered at a dose of 25 to 30 mg/㎡ on day 1; paclitaxel was administered as an intravenous drip at a dose of 45 to 60 mg/㎡ on day 1; and 5-fluorouracil 400 to 800 mg/㎡ was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion for 48 hours on days 1 and 2. Two cycles of chemotherapy were done during radiation therapy at 4-week intervals. All patients received radiation therapy with 6-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator (600CD model; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Two-dimensional or 3-dimensional treatment plans using computed tomography scans were done. The initial treatment volume included the primary tumor with a radial margin of 1.5 to 2 cm and a proximal and distal margin of 3 to 4 cm and enlarged lymph nodes. The received radiation therapy dose of every patient was in the range of 40 Gy to 80 Gy (1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction, 5 days/week), with a median radiation therapy dose of 60 Gy. Among them, 371 patients (90.0%) were in the range of 50 Gy to 70 Gy, and 11 patients (2.7%) were in the range of >70 Gy to 80 Gy. Because of severe acute radiation-induced pneumonitis or esophagitis, 30 patients (7.3%) were dosed from 40 Gy to <50 Gy; 367 patients (89.1%) received 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, whereas 45 patients (10.9%) accepted 2-dimensional radiation therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene are associated with survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) receiving radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy or surgery only. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four tagSNPs of ATM were genotyped in 412 individuals with clinical stage III or IV ESCC receiving radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy, and in 388 individuals with stage I, II, or III ESCC treated with surgery only. Overall survival time of ESCC among different genotypes was estimated by Kaplan-Meier plot, and the significance was examined by log-rank test. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for death from ESCC among different genotypes were computed by a Cox proportional regression model. RESULTS: We found 2 SNPs, rs664143 and rs664677, associated with survival time of ESCC patients receiving radiation therapy. Individuals with the rs664143A allele had poorer median survival time compared with the rs664143G allele (14.0 vs 20.0 months), with the HR for death being 1.45 (95% CI 1.12-1.89). Individuals with the rs664677C allele also had worse median survival time than those with the rs664677T allele (14.0 vs 23.5 months), with the HR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.18-2.08). Stratified analysis showed that these associations were present in both stage III and IV cancer and different radiation therapy techniques. Significant associations were also found between the SNPs and locosregional progression or progression-free survival. No association between these SNPs and survival time was detected in ESCC patients treated with surgery only. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the ATM polymorphisms might serve as independent biomarkers for predicting prognosis in ESCC patients receiving radiation therapy.

Radiotherapy was administered during the pauses between chemotherapy cycles, alternating with chemotherapy, and consisted of 2 Gy daily fractions up to 70 Gy. Radiotherapy was not given on the days when cytotoxic treatment was delivered. Radiotherapy employed the standard 3 shrinking field technique (6 MV photons) with shielding blocks drawn on simulator films to protect critical organs.2 After a cumulative dose of 40 Gy, medulla was excluded from irradiation and high-energy (8–10 MeV) electron beams were used to treat the posterior regions of the neck.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) with cisplatin-based regimens is curative in a subset of patients with locally advanced (stage III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the head and neck (LAHNSCC), but causes considerable toxicity. To seek predictive biomarkers, we analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the p53 and MDM2 genes in LAHNSCC patients treated with cisplatin-based CRT. We analysed germ-line p53 72 Arg/Pro (R/P) and MDM2 309 SNPs and somatic p53 mutational status in 140 LAHNSCC and determined their utility as predictive biomarkers. In cases with wild-type p53, overall survival (OS) was longest in 72RR (median OS=60.8 months) and less favourable in 72PP (median OS=6.7 months, p<0.0001). OS in individuals with 72RP was intermediate between 72RR and 72PP, while in patients with missense p53 mutations, median OS did not reach statistical significance. Median OS was significantly shorter in patients with MDM2 309 SNP genotypes GG or GT, compared to TT (15 vs. 86 months; p<0.0001). The predictive effect of the G allele was maintained independent of age, gender, stage, primary site, nodal status, performance status, EGFR grade, HPV status, p53 mutation and p53 SNP (HR for death 3.241; 95% CI 1.90-5.52, p<0.001). The predictive utility of the MDM2 germ-line 309 SNP, which can be easily determined from peripheral blood, implies that it may be of value in the objective selection of patients for radical CRT. In contrast, the predictive utility of the 72 Arg/Pro SNP in p53 requires mutational analysis of p53, limiting its routine clinical use.	Oral Oncology	Stage III: 17 patients, Stage IV: 123 patients.

Cisplatin was administered at a dose of 80 mg/㎡ as an i.v. drip on day 1; 5-fluorouracil 3 g/㎡ was administered as a continuous i.v. infusion for 48 h on days 1–2. Two cycles of chemotherapy were done during radiotherapy at 4-week intervals. External beam radiotherapy was performed by 6–10 MV X-rays. Two dimensional or three-dimensional treatment plans using computed tomography (CT) scans were done. A total radiation dose of 60–70 Gy (1.8–2 Gy/fraction, 5 days a week) was delivered with 3-field technique, and the treatment field was reduced after 40–46 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) play a critical role in the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The aim of this study is to investigate the associations between insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) gene polymorphisms and ESCC patients risk and survival after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a case-control study to analyze two IGFBP-3 polymorphisms (rs2854744 A>C and rs2854746 G>C) in an Han Chinese population, by extraction of genomic DNA from the peripheral blood of 110 ESCC patients treated with CRT and 128 control participants, and performed IGFBP-3 genotyping using DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The obtained results indicated that overall, no statistically significant association was observed in rs2854746 G>C. However, rs2854744 A>C genotype was at increased risk of ESCCs (P=0.032; odds ratio (OR)=1.201, CI 95%:1.014-1.423). Moreover, rs2854744 A>C genotype ESCCs were more significantly common in patients with tumor size of >6cm than A allele ESCC and in cases of lower T stage. Furthermore, ESCC patients with rs2854744CC genotype have the poorer CRT response and shorter survival time than GG+GC genotype ESCC. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, polymorphism in IGFBP-3 rs2854744 A>C might be a potential predictor of ESCC risk and patient survival. Nevertheless, further investigation with a larger sample size is needed to support our results.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	The promoter variants of TNF-α, a major regulator of immune and inflammation responses, have been implicated in cancer development and prognosis. Thus, we investigated associations between four TNF-α promoter variants and risk of recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP). We evaluated associations of four TNF-α polymorphisms with risk of recurrence in a cohort of 846 patients with SCCOP. Log-rank test and multivariable Cox models were used to evaluate associations. Compared with patients with variant genotypes of the TNF-α -308 and TNF-α -863 polymorphisms, patients with common homozygous genotypes had worse disease-free survival (log-rank p = 0.0002 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and increased risk of SCCOP recurrence (HR, 1.9, 95% CI, 1.3-2.8 and HR, 1.9, 95% CI, 1.3-2.7, respectively) after multivariable adjustment. Furthermore, among patients with HPV16-positive tumors, those with common homozygous genotypes of the TNF-α -308 and -863 polymorphisms had worse disease-free survival (log-rank p = 0.005 and p = 0.007, respectively) and higher recurrence risk than patients with variant genotypes of these polymorphisms (HR, 5.1, 95% CI, 1.4-18.4 and HR, 3.7, 95% CI, 1.5-9.1, respectively), while no such significant associations were found for TNF-α -857 or -1031 polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that TNF-α -308 and -863 polymorphisms may modulate the risk of SCCOP recurrence in patients with HPV16-positive tumors. However, larger studies are needed to validate these results.	International Journal of Cancer	Stage I-II: 60 patients, Stage III-IV: 786 patients.
68	A MDR1 (ABCB1) gene single nucleotide polymorphism predicts outcome of temozolomide treatment in glioblastoma patients	English	2009	18687982	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18687982	Journal Article	\N	112	63	49	63	\N	[18.0,89.0)	Had adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy, and either had no adjuvant chemotherapy or had temozolomide concomitantly and/or adjuvant to radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Some patients with glioblastoma multiform do not respond to temozolomide even though they have aberrant promoter methylation of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT). This suggests that additional factors hamper temozolomide cytotoxicity. We aimed to confirm first that temozolomide is a target for the multidrug resistance transporter MDR1/ABCB1 and second to investigate whether genetic variants of the MDR1 gene are associated with the survival of glioblastoma patients treated with temozolomide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Temozolomide-mediated cytotoxicity was determined by the colorimetric methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay in MDR-expressing and MDR-nonexpressing cell lines. Genotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the MDR1 gene (C1236T, G2677T, and C3435T), MDR1 mRNA expression levels, and the MGMT promoter methylation status were analyzed in 112 glioblastoma patients who had been treated either by surgery plus radiotherapy alone or by additional temozolomide chemotherapy. RESULTS: In vitro analysis revealed that temozolomide-mediated cytotoxicity is dependent on MDR1 expression. Multivariate analysis of MDR1 genotypes showed that the C/C variant of the exon12 C1236T SNP is predictive for survival of patients treated with temozolomide. This effect was independent of the MGMT methylation status. Patients with the C/C genotype had a 2-year overall survival of 37% compared with 8% and 10% for patients with C/T and T/T genotypes, respectively (P=0.02). No influence was seen in the group of patients with radiotherapy only. CONCLUSION: The genotype of the MDR1 exon12 C1236T SNP is a novel independent predictive factor for outcome of temozolomide treatment in glioblastoma patients.	Annals of Oncology	\N
69	Germline Variation in Superoxide Dismutase-2 (SOD2) and Survival Outcomes after Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Results from a Test and Validation Set Analysis	English	2015	25662905	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25662905	Journal Article	\N	1428	1428	\N	\N	\N	[59.0,76.0)	\N	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Genetic variants in antioxidant pathways might decrease the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) by suppressing the generation of reactive oxygen species. We studied the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the antioxidant gene superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2) and cancer-specific outcomes after RT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 816 prostate cancer patients who received radiation as primary therapy from the Physicians' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, we evaluated the association of 7 tagging SNPs in SOD2 with lethal prostate cancer (death from prostate cancer or distant metastasis among living patients). We sought to validate findings in a separate cohort of 612 prostate cancer patients treated with RT with a greater proportion of intermediate and high-risk Gleason scores at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Genetic effects were analyzed using a codominant model, using the genotype homozygous for the major allele as baseline. RESULTS: Among patients who underwent RT in the test cohort, there was a significant association between 3 of the 7 SOD2 SNPs and lethal prostate cancer: rs6917589 (overall P = .006), rs2758331 (P = .04) and the functional valine to alanine polymorphism in rs4880 (P = .04). These SNPs were not associated with outcome among men who had undergone prostatectomy. The associations were not replicated in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: Germline genetic variation in the SOD2 gene might be a predictive biomarker of response to RT for prostate cancer but is not consistently associated with outcome after RT across prostate cancer cohorts with different clinical characteristics.

70	IL12RB2 and ABCA1 genes are associated with susceptibility to radiation dermatitis	English	2008	18927311	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18927311	Journal Article	\N	156	\N	156	48	\N	[23.0,77.0)	Candidate patients were selected from a pool of more than 3,000 female patients who had undergone whole-breast radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery for the treatment of early breast cancer since June 1993 at nine institutions. The eligibility criteria were as follows: (a) patients who had undergone a quadrantectomy or wide excision for unilateral early breast cancer, (b) patients who had received traditional tangential whole-breast irradiation at a total radiation dose of 44 to 52 Gy at a daily fraction of 1.8 to 2.2 Gy over a period of less than 8 wk using a cobalt-60 source or a linear accelerator generating 4 to 6 MV X-rays, (c) patients whose radiation dose distribution was available, (d) patients who did not receive systemic chemotherapy or hormonal therapy except for oral fluorouracil or tamoxifen during the radiotherapy period, and (e) patients whose skin reactions were followed-up for at least 6 mo after the completion of radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Severe acute radiation dermatitis is observed in approximately 5% to 10% of patients who receive whole-breast radiotherapy. Several factors, including treatment-related and patient-oriented factors, are involved in susceptibility to severe dermatitis. Genetic factors are also thought to be related to a patient's susceptibility to severe dermatitis. To elucidate genetic polymorphisms associated with a susceptibility to radiation-induced dermatitis, a large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using DNA samples from 156 patients with breast cancer was conducted. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were selected from more than 3,000 female patients with early breast cancer who received radiotherapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The dermatitis group was defined as patients who developed dermatitis at a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade of > or =2. For the SNP analysis, DNA samples from each patient were subjected to the genotyping of 3,144 SNPs covering 494 genes. RESULTS: SNPs that mapped to two genes, ABCA1 and IL12RB2, were associated with radiation-induced dermatitis. In the ABCA1 gene, one of these SNPs was a nonsynonymous coding SNP causing R219K (P = 0.0065). As for the IL12RB2 gene, the strongest association was observed at SNP-K (rs3790568; P = 0.0013). Using polymorphisms of both genes, the probability of severe dermatitis was estimated for each combination of genotypes. These analyses showed that individuals carrying a combination of genotypes accounting for 14.7% of the Japanese population have the highest probability of developing radiation-induced dermatitis. CONCLUSION: Our results shed light on the mechanisms responsible for radiation-induced dermatitis. These results may also contribute to the individualization of radiotherapy.

71	Genetic Variations in the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR Pathway Are Associated With Clinical Outcomes in Esophageal Cancer Patients Treated With Chemoradiotherapy	English	2009	19164214	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19164214	Journal Article	White	186	161	25	\N	60.7999999999999972	[32.0,79.0)	All patients had undergone chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, or induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy and surgery. More than 97% of the patients (182) were treated with either a fluoropyrimidine, platinum agent, or taxane. Of these 182 patients, 177 received a fluoropyrimidine (95%), 132 received a platinum agent (71%), and 94 received a taxane (51%).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog (AKT), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway has been implicated in resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents. In this retrospective study, we determined whether common genetic variations in this pathway are associated with clinical outcomes in esophageal cancer patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma who have undergone chemoradiotherapy and surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PIK3CA, PTEN, AKT1, AKT2, and FRAP1 (encoding mTOR) were genotyped in these patients and analyzed for associations with response to therapy, survival, and recurrence. RESULTS: We observed an increased recurrence risk with genetic variations in AKT1 and AKT2 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06 to 4.60; and HR, 3.30; 95% CI, 1.64 to 6.66, respectively). This effect was magnified with an increasing number of AKT adverse genotypes. In contrast, a predictable protective effect by PTEN genetic variants on recurrence was evident. Survival tree analysis identified higher-order interactions that resulted in variation in recurrence-free survival from 12 to 42 months, depending on the combination of SNPs. Genetic variations in AKT1, AKT2, and FRAP1 were associated with survival. Patients homozygous for either of the FRAP1 SNPs assayed had a more than three-fold increased risk of death. Two genes--AKT2 and FRAP1--were associated with a poor treatment response, while a better response was associated with heterozygosity for AKT1:rs3803304 (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.99). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that common genetic variations in this pathway modulate clinical outcomes in patients who undergo chemoradiotherapy. With further validation, these results may be used to build a model of individualized therapy for the selection of the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen.	Journal of Clinical Oncology	\N
72	GNAS1 T393C polymorphism is associated with histopathological response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer	English	2009	19274060	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19274060	Journal Article	\N	51	42	9	59	\N	[38.0,73.0)	All patients received standardized neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Cisplatin (20 mg/㎡/day) was administered as short-term infusion on days 1–5 and 5-FU (1000 mg/㎡/day) as continuous infusion over 24 h on days 1–5. Radiation was administered by linear accelerators with 10–15 MV and delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1–5, 8–12, 15–19 and 22–26) with a total dose of 36 Gy using multiple field technique. Standardized transthoracic en bloc esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy and reconstruction by gastric tube interposition with either left cervical or high intrathoracic anastomosis was performed 4–5 weeks following completion of radiochemotherapy in all patients.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Recent studies have shown an association between the GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and clinical outcome for various solid tumors. In this study, we genotyped 51 patients from an observational trial on cisplatin/5-FU-based neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy of locally advanced esophageal cancer (cT2-4, Nx, M0) and genotyping was correlated with histomorphological tumor regression. The C-allele frequency in esophageal cancer patients was 0.49. Pearson's chi(2)-test showed a significant (P<0.05) association between tumor regression grades and T393C genotypes. Overall, 63% of the patients in the T-allele group (TT+CT) were minor responders with more than 10% residual vital tumor cells in resection specimens, whereas T(-) genotypes (CC) showed a major histopathological response with less than 10% residual vital tumor cells in 80%. The results support the role of the T393C polymorphism as a predictive molecular marker for tumor response to cisplatin/5-FU-based radiochemotherapy in esophageal cancer.

73	The genetic variations in DNA repair genes ERCC2 and XRCC1 were associated with the overall survival of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients	English	2016	27465648	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27465648	Journal Article	\N	131	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	It was reported that DNA repair can confer cancer cell resistance to therapeutic treatments by activating antiapoptotic cellular defense. We hypothesized that genetic variants of DNA repair genes may be associated with lung cancer prognosis. Seventeen tagging single-nucleotide polymorphism (tagSNPs) selected from 12 DNA repair genes were genotyped in 280 advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by TaqMan assay. The associations of these SNPs and overall survival of advanced NSCLC patients were investigated. Advanced NSCLC patients carrying ERCC2 rs50872 CT+TT genotypes had significantly longer median survival time (MST) and decreased death risk than patients with rs50872 CC genotype [log-rank P = 0.031; adjusted HR(95% CI) = 0.73 (0.55-0.98), P = 0.033]. These effects were mainly seen among younger patients (≤65 years old) [HR(95% CI) = 0.57 (0.37-0.87), P = 0.010], patients without surgery [HR(95% CI) = 0.68 (0.47-0.98), P = 0.036] but with chemotherapy [HR(95% CI) = 0.64 (0.46-0.91), P = 0.012] or radiotherapy [HR(95% CI) = 0.58 (0.38-0.89), P = 0.013]. Meanwhile, compared to advanced NSCLC patients with rs25487 GG genotype, patients carrying XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotypes had significantly shorter MST (MST = 11.7 vs. 16.7, log-rank P = 0.048). In addition, advanced NSCLC patients carrying the ERCC2 rs50872 CC in combination with XRCC1 rs25487 GA+AA genotype had the shortest MST (11.2 month) and highest death risk [HR(95% CI) = 1.70 (1.15-2.52), P = 0.008] when compared with those carrying rs50872 CT+TT and rs25487 GG genotype (MST = 22.0 month). The ERCC2 rs50872 T allele was associated with favorable but XRCC1 rs25487 A allele with bad survival for advanced NSCLC in Chinese population, which may offer novel biomarkers for predicting clinical outcomes.

75	The role of microRNA-binding site polymorphisms in DNA repair genes as risk factors for bladder cancer and breast cancer and their impact on radiotherapy outcomes	English	2012	22166496	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166496	Journal Article	\N	202	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The radiotherapy cohort consisted of 202 muscle-invasive bladder cancer cases treated with external beam radiotherapy (52.5–55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) between August 2002 and October 2009 at Cookridge Hospital and St James Institute of Oncology, Leeds, UK. A total of 257 breast cancer cases and 512 controls over the age of 30 years were recruited between February 1996 and April 2002.	Radiotherapy	5	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression through binding to messenger RNAs (mRNA) thereby promoting mRNA degradation or altered translation. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located within a miRNA-binding site could thus alter mRNA translation and influence cancer risk and treatment response. The common SNPs located within the 3'-untranslated regions of 20 DNA repair genes were analysed for putative miRNA-binding sites using bioinformatics algorithms, calculating the difference in Gibbs free binding energy (ΔΔG) for each wild-type versus variant allele. Seven SNPs were selected to be genotyped in germ line DNAs both from a bladder cancer case-control series (752 cases and 704 controls) and 202 muscle-invasive bladder cancer radiotherapy cases. The PARP-1 SNP rs8679 was also genotyped in a breast cancer case-control series (257 cases and 512 controls). Without adjustment for multiple testing, multivariate analysis demonstrated an association with increased bladder cancer risk with PARP1 rs8679 (P(trend) = 0.05) while variant homozygotes of PARP1 rs8679 were also noted to have an increased breast cancer risk (P = 0.03). In the radiotherapy cases, carriers of the RAD51 rs7180135 minor allele had improved cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.87, P = 0.01). This is the first report of associations between DNA repair gene miRNA-binding site SNPs with bladder and breast cancer risk and radiotherapy outcomes. If validated, these findings may give further insight into the biology of bladder carcinogenesis, allow testing of the RAD51 SNP as a potential predictive biomarker and also reveal potential targets for new cancer treatments.

76	Genetic variants of the LIN28B gene predict severe radiation pneumonitis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy	English	2014	24780874	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24780874	Journal Article	Black; White	362	200	162	65	\N	[35.0,88.0)	The median radiation dose received by patients was 66 Gy (range, 50.0–87.5 Gy) with a median mean lung dose (MLD) of 19.0 Gy (range, 2.7–30.6 Gy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: LIN28 is an RNA-binding protein that not only plays key roles in multiple cellular developmental processes and tumourigenesis, but also is involved in tissue inflammatory response. However, no published study has investigated associations between genetic variants in LIN28 and radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiation therapy. METHODS: We genotyped eight potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of LIN28A (rs11247946 T>C, rs3811464 C>T, rs11581746 T>C, and rs12728900 G>A) and LIN28B (rs314280 G>A, rs12194974 G>A, rs17065417 A>C and rs314276 C>A) in 362 patients with NSCLC, who received definitive radio(chemo)therapy. The associations between RP risk and genotypes were assessed by hazards ratio (HR) in Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with time to event considered with and without adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Multivariate analyses found that patients carrying LIN28B rs314280 AG and AA/AG or rs314276 AC and AA/AC genotypes had a higher risk of grade ≥3 RP (for rs314280 AG and AA/AG versus GG, adjusted HR=2.97 and 2.23, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.32-6.72 and 1.01-4.94, P=0.009 and 0.048, respectively; for rs314276 AC and AA/AC versus CC, adjusted HR=2.30 and 2.00, 95% CI=1.24-4.28 and 1.11-3.62, and P=0.008 and 0.022, respectively). Further stratified analyses showed a more consistent and profound risk in the subgroups of age <65years, males, stage III/IV, ever smokers, having radio-chemotherapy and mean lung dose (MLD) ≥19.0Gy. CONCLUSION: Genetic variants of LIN28B, but not LIN28A, may be biomarkers for susceptibility to severe RP in NSCLC patients. Large, prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.

77	Functional promoter variant rs2868371 of HSPB1 is associated with risk of radiation pneumonitis after chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer	English	2013	23374503	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23374503	Journal Article	White; Other	271	153	118	\N	\N	[39.0,94.0)	Techniques for treatment planning and delivery changed considerably during the study period, with 3-dimensional (3D) CT-based simulation and 3D conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) used before July 2004 and 4- dimensional CT-based simulation with respiratory motion management and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or proton beam radiation (PBT) used thereafter. For this study, our training dataset comprised 146 patients treated from 1999 through July 2004 (most by 3D-CRT), and our validation data set comprised 125 patients treated from August 2004 through March 2010 (most by IMRT or PBT).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To date, no biomarkers have been found to predict, before treatment, which patients will develop radiation pneumonitis (RP), a potentially fatal toxicity, after chemoradiation for lung cancer. We investigated potential associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HSPB1 and risk of RP after chemoradiation for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subjects were patients with NSCLC treated with chemoradiation at 1 institution. The training data set comprised 146 patients treated from 1999 to July 2004; the validation data set was 125 patients treated from August 2004 to March 2010. We genotyped 2 functional SNPs of HSPB1 (rs2868370 and rs2868371) from all patients. We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to assess the risk of grade ≥2 or ≥3 RP in both data sets and a parametric log-logistic survival model to evaluate the association of HSPB1 genotypes with that risk. RESULTS: Grade ≥3 RP was experienced by 13% of those with CG/GG and 29% of those with CC genotype of HSPB1 rs2868371 in the training data set (P=.028); corresponding rates in the validation data set were 2% CG/GG and 14% CC (P=.02). Univariate and multivariate analysis confirmed the association of CC of HSPB1 rs2868371 with higher risk of grade ≥3 RP than CG/GG after adjustment for sex, age, performance status, and lung mean dose. This association was validated both in the validation data set and with Harrell's C statistic. CONCLUSIONS: The CC genotype of HSPB1 rs2868371 was associated with severe RP after chemoradiation for NSCLC.

78	Genetic Variation in BCL2 3′-UTR Was Associated with Lung Cancer Risk and Prognosis in Male Chinese Population	English	2013	23977251	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23977251	Journal Article	Chinese	110	110	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	OBJECTIVES: Bcl-2 is a critical apoptosis inhibitor with established carcinogenic potential, and can confer cancer cell resistance to therapeutic treatments by activating anti-apoptotic cellular defense. We hypothesized that genetic variants of BCL2 gene may be associated with lung cancer susceptibility and prognosis. METHODS: Three selected tagSNPs of BCL2 (rs2279115, rs1801018, and rs1564483) were genotyped in 1017 paired male Chinese lung cancer cases and controls by TaqMan assay. The associations of these variants with risk of lung cancer and overall survival of 242 male advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were separately investigated. RESULTS: Compared with the BCL2 3'UTR rs1564483GG genotype, the rs1564483GA, AA, and GA+AA genotypes were associated with significantly decreased susceptibilities of lung cancer in male Chinese (adjusted OR = 0.78, 0.73, and 0.76, P = 0.016, 0.038, and 0.007, respectively), while rs1564483A allele has a inverse dose-response relationship with lung cancer risk (P trend = 0.010). These effects were more evident in the elders, smokers, and subjects without family history of cancer (P trend = 0.017, 0.043 and 0.005, respectively). Furthermore, advanced NSCLC males carrying BCL2 rs1564483 GA+AA genotypes had significantly longer median survival time (Long-rank P = 0.036) and decreased death risk (adjusted HR = 0.69, P = 0.027) than patients with rs1564483GG genotype. These effects were more obvious in patients with smoking, stage IIIA, and in patients without surgery but underwent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (adjusted HR = 0.68, 0.49, 0.67, 0.69, 0.50, respectively, all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The BCL2 3'UTR rs1564483A allele was associated with a decreased lung cancer risk and better survival for advanced NSCLC in male Chinese, which may offer a novel biomarker for identifying high-risk population and predicting clinical outcomes.

79	The Tumoral A genotype of the MGMT rs34180180 single-nucleotide polymorphism in aggressive gliomas is associated with shorter patients' survival	English	2016	26717998	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26717998	Journal Article	\N	87	51	36	\N	61.2999999999999972	[29.0,81.0)	In a cohort of 87 malignant gliomas treated with radiotherapy and TMZ-based chemotherapy, we retrospectively determined the MGMT promoter methylation status, genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region and quantified MGMT mRNA expression level.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Grade III and IV gliomas harboring wild-type IDH1/2 are the most aggressive. In addition to surgery and radiotherapy, concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) significantly improves overall survival (OS). The methylation status of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter is predictive of TMZ response and a prognostic marker of cancer outcome. However, the promoter regions the methylation of which correlates best with survival in aggressive glioma and whether the promoter methylation status predictive value could be refined or improved by other MGMT-associated molecular markers are not precisely known. In a cohort of 87 malignant gliomas treated with radiotherapy and TMZ-based chemotherapy, we retrospectively determined the MGMT promoter methylation status, genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region and quantified MGMT mRNA expression level. Each of these variables was correlated with each other and with the patients' OS. We found that methylation of the CpG sites within MGMT exon 1 best correlated with OS and MGMT expression levels, and confirmed MGMT methylation as a stronger independent prognostic factor compared to MGMT transcription levels. Our main finding is that the presence of only the A allele at the rs34180180 SNP in the tumor was significantly associated with shorter OS, independently of the MGMT methylation status. In conclusion, in the clinic, rs34180180 SNP genotyping could improve the prognostic value of the MGMT promoter methylation assay in patients with aggressive glioma treated with TMZ.

Postoperative treatment was not performed. Resection of the oesophagus and the proximal stomach was performed by a combined right thoracal and abdominal approach. Resection included excision of the paraoesophageal, paracardial, left gastric, and celiac lymph nodes.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	The present study retrospectively examined the correlation between the outcome of patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (cT3-4 cN0-1 cM0) after multimodal treatment (radiochemotherapy+/-surgical resection), and the presence of genetic polymorphisms in genes involved in folate metabolism. In total, 68 patients who took part in a prospective multicentric trial received 5-fluorouracil (FU)-based radiochemotherapy, optionally followed by surgery. DNA was extracted from pretherapeutic tumour biopsies and was subsequently genotyped for common genetic polymorphisms of three genes (MTHFR C677T, MTR A2756G, TS tandem repeat polymorphism) involved in folate metabolism and potentially in sensitivity to 5-FU-based chemotherapy. The genotypes were correlated with tumour response to polychemotherapy, radiochemotherapy and with overall survival. Tumours with the MTR wild-type genotype (2756AA) showed a median survival time of 16 months, whereas tumours with an MTR variant genotype (2756AG/2756GG) showed a median survival time of 42 months (P=0.0463). No prognostic impact could be verified for the genotypes of the MTHFR genes and the TS gene. Among tumours treated with radiochemotherapy and subsequent resection, MTR variant genotype showed higher histopathological response rate than tumours with MTR wild-type genotype (P=0.0442). In contrast, no significant relationship between clinically determined tumour regression after polychemotherapy and polymorphisms of the three genes under analysis was observed. In conclusion, pretherapeutic determination of the MTR A2756G polymorphism may predict survival of multimodally treated oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas. Determination of MTHFR C677T and TS tandem repeat polymorphism has no predictive value.	British Journal of Cancer	\N
80	KEAP1 Genetic Polymorphisms Associate with Breast Cancer Risk and Survival Outcomes	English	2015	25589623	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25589623	Journal Article	Finnish Caucasian	703	\N	703	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Defective oxidative stress response may increase cancer susceptibility. In tumors, these rescue mechanisms may cause chemo- and radioresistance impacting patient outcome. We previously showed that genetic variation in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NFE2L2) is associated with breast cancer risk and prognosis. Here we further studied this pathway by investigating Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Five tagging SNPs in the KEAP1 gene were genotyped in 996 breast cancer cases and 880 controls from two Finnish case-control sets. KEAP1 protein expression was studied in 373 invasive breast cancer tumors. RESULTS: rs34197572 genotype TT was associated with increased risk of breast cancer in the KBCP samples [P = 1.8×10(-4); OR, 7.314; confidence interval (CI), 2.185-24.478]. rs11085735 allele A was associated with lower KEAP1 protein expression (P = 0.040; OR,= 3.545) and high nuclear NRF2 expression (P = 0.009; OR, 2.445) and worse survival in all invasive cases (P = 0.023; HR, 1.634). When including treatment data, rs11085735 was associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS; P = 0.020; HR, 1.545) and breast cancer-specific survival (P = 0.016; HR, 1.683) and rs34197572 with overall survival (P = 0.045; HR, 1.304). rs11085735 associated with RFS also among tamoxifen-treated cases (P = 0.003; HR, 3.517). Among radiotherapy-treated cases, overall survival was associated with rs34197572 (P = 0.018; HR, 1.486) and rs8113472 (P = 0.025; HR, 1.455). RFS was associated with rs9676881 (P = 0.024; HR, 1.452) and rs1048290 (P = 0.020; HR, 1.468) among all invasive cases and among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tamoxifen-treated cases (P = 0.018; HR, 2.407 and P = 0.015; HR, 2.476, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the investigated SNPs have effects related to oxidative stress induced by cancer treatment, supporting involvement of the NRF2/KEAP1 pathway in breast cancer susceptibility and patient outcome.

81	Expression of pAkt affects p53 codon 72 polymorphism-based prediction of response to radiotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2013	23663243	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23663243	Journal Article	Chinese Han	75	57	18	45	\N	[22.0,72.0)	Megavoltage photons (6 MV) were used to treat primary tumor and neck lymph nodes. Radiotherapy was administered five times a week at a dose of 2 Gy/d. The accumulated radiation dose to the primary tumor was 68 to 72 Gy, 60 to 62 Gy to the involved areas of the neck, and 50 Gy to uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy, specifically, DDP (100 mg/㎡) on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy, was administered to 39 patients.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Codon 72 (Arg/Pro), the most frequently studied single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of p53 to date, is associated with the ability of the gene to induce cell apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt pathway plays an essential role in the transcriptional activation function of p53, and is an important factor in radiotherapy resistance. The present study was designed to evaluate the prediction of response to radiotherapy based on p53 codon 72 SNP and pAkt expression in biopsy specimens of locoregional nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) before treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 75 consecutive patients with locoregional NPC were enrolled. The p53 codon 72 SNP was identified from retrospectively collected paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens using Sanger sequencing. Expression patterns of p53, p21, 14-3-3σ, and pAkt proteins were investigated using immunohistochemical analyses. The effects of genetic polymorphisms and protein expression on progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier method, and log-rank test. RESULTS: The p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro carriers showed lower risk of disease progression (local recurrence and distant metastases) (HR: 0.300; 95% CI: 0.092-0.983; p=0.047). However, this association between the p53 codon 72 polymorphism and PFS was not significant in the pAkt-positive subgroup. No association was observed between protein expression of p53, p21 or 14-3-3σ and p53 codon72 polymorphisms. Notably, positive expression of p53 protein appeared to be correlated with poorer PFS among patients diagnosed as local regional lymph node metastasis (N+) before treatment (p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The p53 codon 72 Pro/Pro genotype may be an effective independent prognostic marker for better outcome in patients with locoregional NPC. Based on the current findings, we hypothesize that pAkt weakens the predictive value of p53 codon 72 SNP in NPC. A combination of positive p53 protein expression and local regional lymph node metastasis may additionally be predictive of high risk of disease progression.

Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8Gy to a total dose of 36Gy using a multiple-field technique. Standardized transthoracic en blocesophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy was performed 4-5 weeks after completion of chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant treatment strategies have been developed to improve survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. Since only patients with major histopathological response benefit from this therapy, predictive markers are needed. We examined a panel of selected gene polymorphisms to predict response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, 36 Gy) in esophageal cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Genomic DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues of 52 patients. Allelic genotyping was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using allele-specific TaqMan probes and correlated with therapy response. RESULTS: Single-nucleotide polymorphism ERCC1 C118T was predictive for therapy response (p < 0.003). Within the TT genotype group of 25 patients, 20 (80%) did not respond to chemoradiation. Of 20 patients with heterogeneous C/T genotype, 14 (70%) were major responders. The CC genotype (seven patients) was not of predictive importance. ERCC1 polymorphism was significantly (p < 0.02) associated with formation of lymph node metastases. Predominant GG genotype of XRCC1 A194G was not predictive; however, the rarely occurring AA genotype was response-associated and the A/G variant was associated with nonresponse. Fifteen additionally analyzed polymorphisms did not show any correlation. CONCLUSION: Our data support the role of ERCC1 as a predictive marker for therapy response. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms of ERCC1 and XRCC1 could be applied to further individualize treatment strategies.

83	ERCC1 and ERCC2 variants predict survival in gastric cancer patients	English	2013	24023723	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24023723	Journal Article	\N	114	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: ERCC1 and ERCC2 play critical roles in the nucleotide excision repair pathway that effectively repairs DNA damage induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes could have an impact on clinical outcomes in cancer patients who received chemotherapy. However, few studies have simultaneously investigated the roles of ERCC1 and ERCC2 SNPs in clinical outcomes in gastric cancer patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped by the TaqMan assay three common, potentially functional ERCC1 (rs3212986) and ERCC2 SNPs (rs13181 and rs1799793) in 360 gastric cancer patients. We used both Kaplan-Meier tests and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate the effects of ERCC1 and ERCC2 genotypes and haplotypes on clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that, compared with ERCC2 rs1799793 GG+AG genotypes, the homozygous variant AA genotype was associated with significantly poorer overall survival (OS) (AA vs. GG+AG, log-rank P=0.012) and significantly higher risk of death (AA vs. GG+AG, Adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 2.13; 95% CI, 1.28 to 3.56; P=0.004). In combined analyses, patients with any one of the three unfavorable genotypes (i.e. ERCC1 rs3212986 TT, ERCC2 rs13181 GG and rs1799793 AA) had statistically significant hazards of poor prognosis (Adjusted HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.25; P=0.025), compared with those without any unfavorable genotypes. Furthermore, the haplotype A-G-G (rs1799793/rs13181/rs3212986) had a significant impact on OS (Adjusted HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.21; P=0.011), compared with the common haplotype G-T-G. CONCLUSION: ERCC1 and ERCC2 functional SNPs may jointly affect OS in Caucasian gastric cancer patients. Additional large prospective studies are essential to confirm our findings.	Plos One	\N

Patients in SG1 underwent TME an average of 6 weeks after completing CRT (standard of care). Following CRT, patients in SG2 and SG3 with signs of stable disease or disease progression compared with baseline staging had surgery without further delay. All other patients received 2 and 4 cycles of additional chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6), respectively; leucovorin 200 mg/㎡ or 400 mg/㎡ plus oxaliplatin 85 mg/㎡ by 2h infusion, followed by bolus of 5-FU 400 mg/㎡ and a 46h infusion of 5-FU 2,400 mg/㎡ . Patients in SG2 and SG3 underwent TME an average of 11 and 16 weeks after completing CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: To identify a biomarker profile associated with tumor response to chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer response to neoadjuvant CRT is variable. Whereas some patients have a minimal response, others achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) and have no viable cancer cells in their surgical specimens. Identifying biomarkers of response will help select patients more likely to benefit from CRT. METHODS: This study includes 132 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery. Tumor DNA from pretreatment tumor biopsies and control DNA from paired normal surgical specimens was screened for mutations and polymorphisms in 23 genes. Genetic biomarkers were correlated with tumor response to CRT (pCR vs non-pCR), and the association of single or combined biomarkers with tumor response was determined. RESULTS: Thirty-three of 132 (25%) patients achieved a pCR and 99 (75%) patients had non-pCR. Three individual markers were associated with non-pCR; v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutation (P = 0.0145), cyclin D1 G870A (AA) polymorphism (P = 0.0138), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NAD(P)H) C677T (TT) polymorphism (P = 0.0120). Analysis of biomarker combinations revealed that none of the 27 patients with both tumor protein p53 (p53) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutations had a pCR. Further, in patients with both p53 and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog mutations or the cyclin D1 G870A (AA) polymorphism or the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NAD(P)H) C677T (TT) polymorphism (n = 52) the association with non-pCR was further strengthened; 51 of 52 (98%) of patients were non-pCR. These biomarker combinations had a validity of more than 70% and a positive predictive value of 97% to 100%, predicting that patients harboring these mutation/polymorphism profiles will not achieve a pCR. CONCLUSIONS: A specific biomarker profile is strongly associated with non-pCR to CRT and could be used to select optimal oncologic therapy in rectal cancer patients.

85	Transforming growth factor beta 1 genotype and p16 as prognostic factors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	English	2012	22667340	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22667340	Journal Article	\N	37	32	5	\N	\N	[31.0,77.0)	Of these 37 underwent chemoradiotherapy as the initial planned treatment modality and 10 of these underwent subsequent salvage surgery.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	CONCLUSION: Transforming growth factor β1 gene (TGFβ1) genotype is a potential p16 independent prognostic factor predicting response to chemoradiotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). OBJECTIVES: Expression of p16 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to be associated with survival in HNSCC. We have previously reported that genetic polymorphism of TGFβ1 is linked with survival in HNSCC patients who have undergone chemoradiotherapy. We evaluate here whether TGFB1 genotype can serve as a prognostic factor independent of tumor p16 and EGFR expression. METHODS: Expression of p16 and EGFR was studied by immunohistochemistry in tumors from 130 HNSCC patients. Peripheral blood DNA was used to genotype 95 patients for single nucleotide polymorphism rs1800470 within the TGFβ1 gene. The minimum follow-up time was 31 months. RESULTS: p16 overexpression was associated with an improved disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.78), whereas no evident association was observed between EGFR expression and disease-free survival (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.68-1.19). Among the 37 patients who had received chemoradiotherapy, TGFβ1 genotype was associated with disease-free (HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-1.02) and overall survival (HR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.12-0.80) independent of tumor p16 expression.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Recurrence and toxicity occur commonly among patients with rectal cancer who are treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The authors hypothesized that genetic variation in folate-metabolizing genes could play a role in interindividual variability. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the associations between genetic variants in folate-metabolizing genes and clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU. METHODS: The authors investigated 8 functionally significant polymorphisms in 6 genes (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] [C677T, A1298C], SLC19A1 [G80A], SHMT1 [C1420T], dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] [Del19bp], TS 1494del,and TSER) involved in folate metabolism in 745 patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer enrolled in a phase 3 adjuvant clinical trial of 3 regimens of 5-FU and radiotherapy (INT-0144 and SWOG 9304). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations noted between polymorphisms in any of the genes and overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity in the overall analyses. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward worse DFS among patients with the variant allele of MTHFR C677T compared with wild-type, particularly in treatment arm 2, in which patients with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had worse overall survival (hazards ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.93 [P = .03]) and DFS (hazards ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.03 [P = .02]) compared with those with homozygous wild-type. In addition, there was a trend toward reduced hematological toxicity among patients with variants of SLC19A1 G80A in treatment arm 1 (P for trend, .06) and reduced esophagitis/stomatitis noted among patients with variants of TSER in treatment arm 3 (P for trend, .06). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variability in folate-metabolizing enzymes was found to be associated only to a limited degree with clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU.

Dose-planning was performed with a computer tomography-based RT planning program. Thirty-two patients received definitive CRT and the remaining two patients postoperative modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and 15 by conventional three-dimensional radiotherapy (3D). The mean total dose was 69 Gy, (range, 66-72 Gy) given at 2 Gy fractions, five fractions per week. In patients treated by definitive CRT the clinical target volume (CTV) first encompassed the primary tumor and locoregional lymph nodes up to a toal dose of 50 Gy (CTV1) and after CTV1 was finished a mean boost dose of 19 Gy (range, 16-22 Gy) was given to the primary tumor and positive lymph nodes (CTV2). In the two patients treated by postoperative RT, the corresponding doses was 50 Gy for CTV1, and 10, respectively, 20 Gy for CTV2 encompassing the resection area of the primary tumoe. The average total treatment tiem was  53 days (range, 42-66 days). Eight patients had an unplanned treatment gap due to adverse effects of CRT during the treatment course. The mean duration of the gap was 8 days (range, 2-16 days). Patients were treated with cisplatin either at 100 mg/㎡ once every 3 weeks for three cycles or at 40 mg/㎡ once at a week for 6 or 7 cycles. The average cisplatin dose was 219 mg/㎡ (range, 80-300 mg/㎡). Fourteen of the patients got the planned amount of chemotherapy (CT), the majority (N=20) getting either a reduced number of cycles or a reduced dose. In one case the cisplatin was changed into carboplatin after the first cycle because of kidney toxicity. Four patients were concomitantly treated with peroral gefitinib 250 mg once a day. Six patients underwent surgery in addition to chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Two of them had planned surgery before CRT and four had salvage surgery because of advanced neck disease or a residual tumor after CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often accompanied by severe mucosal reactions. We have recently shown that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1982073 of the TGFbeta1 gene (TGFB1) is associated with the survival of HNSCC patients who have undergone CRT. In order to evaluate possible mechanisms mediating this, we investigated if the TGFB1 polymorphism was associated with the severity of mucositis induced by CRT. Peripheral blood DNA of 34 HNSCC patients who had undergone CRT was genotyped for the SNP rs1982073 of the TGFB1. Mucositis was graded according to acute toxicity criteria of radiation therapy oncology group (RTOG). The mean follow-up time was 48 months (range, 4-115 months). We did not find a significant association between the TGFB1 polymorphism and the degree of acute mucositis (OD=2.65; 95% CI 0.50-13.89; p=0.25). The degree of acute mucositis was not connected to disease-free survival (p=0.35). However, the TGFB1 polymorphism was associated with survival irrespective of the degree of mucositis (HR=3.23; 95% CI 1.19-8.77; p=0.02).

In most patients, the regimen (based on Shipley's method with slight modification) for one cycle was cisplatin (70 mg/㎡) on day 1, with radiation administered by Liniac to the true pelvis at 1.8 grays (Gy) per fraction from day 2 to day 5 in the first week, and on five consecutive days in the second week. The photon energy of the Liniac was 10 MV and patient-specific target volume was defined by chemotherapy (CT) planning. This therapy was carried out one to three times every 14 days. At completion of one cycle of CRT, patients were treated with 70 mg/㎡ cisplatin and irradiation of the basic target at 16.2 Gy. Although we tried to perform three cycles of CRT where possible, the treatment was halted in patients who received one or two cycles of therapy and showed persistent side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or pancytopenia for 2 weeks or who refused to continue with CRT. The median total doses of cisplatin and radiation were 235 mg (range, 120–400 mg) and 48.6 Gy (range, 30–60.4 Gy), respectively.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	DNA repair enzymes repair DNA damaged by platinum agents and ionising radiation. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DNA repair genes modulate the repair capacity and might affect response and prognosis following platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We investigated associations between the functional SNPs in DNA repair genes and response and survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients treated with CRT to determine the predictive value of the SNPs in patient selection for bladder conservation therapy. The study group comprised 78 patients who underwent CRT for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in xeroderma pigmentosum complementation groups C (Lys939Gln, A/C), D (XPD; Lys751Gln, A/C), and G (Asp1104His, G/C), and X-ray repair cross-complementing groups 1 (XRCC1; Arg399Gln, G/A) and 3 (Thr241Met, T/C) genes were genotyped. Combined genotypes with at least one variant allele in XPD or XRCC1 were significantly associated with improved cancer-specific survival compared with remaining groups (P=0.009). In multivariate analysis, only the combined XPD and XRCC1 genotypes were independently associated with cancer-specific survival (P=0.04). The association was stronger in stage T3/T4 patients (P=0.0008). These results suggest that combined XPD and XRCC1 genotypes might be prognostic factors in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients treated with CRT.

We applied a candidate-gene approach to evaluate the effect of putative markers on survival of patients with pancreatic cancer. We also examined gene-radiotherapy and gene-chemotherapy interactions, aiming to explain interindividual differences in treatment outcomes. METHODS: In total, 211 patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited in a population-based study. Sixty-four candidate genes associated with cancer survival or treatment response were selected from existing publications. Genotype information was obtained from a previous genome-wide association study data set. The main effects of genetic variation and gene-specific treatment interactions on overall survival were examined by proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Fourteen genes showed evidence of association with pancreatic cancer survival. Among these, rs1760217, located at the DPYD gene; rs17091162 at SERPINA3; and rs2231164 at ABCG2 had the lowest P of 10(-4.60), 0.0013, and 0.0023, respectively. We also observed that 2 genes, RRM1 and IQGAP2, had significant interactions with radiotherapy in association with survival, and 2 others, TYMS and MET, showed evidence of interaction with 5-fluorouracil and erlotinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested significant associations between germ-line genetic polymorphisms and overall survival in pancreatic cancer, as well as survival interactions between various genes and radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

These patients were also stratified by radiation dose (high or low defined as above or below the median).	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The p53 tumor suppression pathway is important in effects associated with radiotherapy. The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) plays a pivotal role in this pathway by down regulating p53. A functional T-to-G polymorphism at nucleotide 309 in MDM2 promoter intron 1 (SNP309) has been identified which influenced transcription activity. A G-to-C SNP at p53 codon 72 results in an Arg/Pro polymorphism, which is associated with apoptosis induction potential and p53 mutation status. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We sequenced both MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon 72 SNP in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC, n=189), oral submucosal fibrosis (OSF, n=70), and 116 controls. RESULTS: Neither MDM2 SNP309 nor p53 codon 72 SNP was associated with susceptibility to or the age at onset of OSCC or OSF. p53 codon 72 SNP Arg/Arg polymorphism was associated with the progression of OSCC, and the overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of irradiated patients. The MDM2 SNP309 G/G polymorphism was associated with poor OS in advanced OSCC, and the OS and DSF of irradiated patients. The combination of MDM2 SNP309 G/G and p53 codon 72 Arg/Arg polymorphism is associated with the worst OS and DFS. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced OSCC has high mortality and recurrence. We identified that both MDM2 SNP309 and p53 codon 72 SNP could be useful factors for evaluating the outcome of advanced OSCC treated with adjuvant radiation.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	\N
92	Genetic polymorphisms of Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes are associated with the efficacy and toxicities of radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2016	27769064	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769064	Journal Article	\N	188	130	58	\N	50.7000000000000028	[14.0,81.0)	A total of 38 patients were treated with RT alone and the remaining 150 were treated with RT and chemotherapy. All patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation-therapy (IMRT) technique. The prescribed dosage of radiation therapy was 66 – 70 Gy in 30 – 33 fractions for nasopharyngeal primary focus and the cervical positive lymph nodes and 54 – 60 Gy in 30 – 33 fractions for cervical drainage region, respectively. One fraction was performed daily and five fractions weekly. Induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy were all performed with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Radiotherapy (RT) is the normative therapeutic treatment for primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of genes in Wnt/β-catenin pathway are correlated to the development, prognosis, and treatment benefit of various cancers. However, it has not been established whether SNPs of Wnt/β-catenin pathway are associated with nasopharyngeal tumorigenesis and the efficacy of RT in NPC patients. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the nine potentially functional SNPs of four genes in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and genotyped these in 188 NPC patients treated with RT. To achieve this goal, associations between these SNPs and the RT's curative efficacy, as well as acute radiation-induced toxic reaction were determined by multifactorial logistic regression. We observed that catenin beta 1 gene (CTNNB1) rs1880481 and rs3864004, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta gene (GSK3β) rs3755557 polymorphisms were significantly associated with poorer efficacy of RT in NPC patients. Moreover, GSK3β rs375557 and adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) rs454886 polymorphisms were correlated with acute grade 3-4 radiation-induced dermatitis and oral mucositis, respectively. In conclusion, this study suggests that gene polymorphisms of Wnt/β-catenin may be novel prognostic factors for NPC patients treated with RT.

93	Genetic variants in PI3K/AKT pathway are associated with severe radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients treated with radiation therapy	English	2015	26645682	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645682	Journal Article	\N	261	198	63	\N	\N	\N	52.1% underwent surgery before RT, almost all patients (96.2%) received induction chemotherapy before radiotherapy, 26.4% had concurrent chemoradiation, and 25.3% patients received both induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiation. The median radiation dose was 54 Gy (range from 45 to 66 Gy), the median MLD was 13.50 Gy (range from 1.78 to 20.17 Gy), and the median V 20 was 24.15% (range from 0 to 42.00%).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PI3K/AKT pathway plays important roles in inflammatory and fibrotic diseases while its connection to radiation pneumonitis (RP) is unclear. In this study, we explored the associations of genetic variants in PI3K/AKT pathway with RP in lung cancer patients with radiotherapy. Two hundred and sixty one lung cancer patients with radiotherapy were included in this prospective study (NCT02490319) and genotyped by MassArray and Sanger Sequence methods. By multivariate Cox hazard analysis and multiple testing, GA/GG genotype of AKT2: rs33933140 (HR = 0.272, 95% CI: 0.140-0.530, P = 1.3E-4, Pc = 9.1E-4), and the GT/GG genotype of PI3CA: rs9838117 (HR = 0.132, 95% CI: 0.042-0.416, P = 0.001, Pc = 0.006) were found to be strongly associated with a decreased occurrence of RP ≥ grade 3. And patients with the CT/TT genotype of AKT2: rs11880261 had a notably higher incidence of RP ≥ grade 3 (HR = 2.950, 95% CI: 1.380-6.305, P = 0.005, Pc = 0.025). We concluded that the genetic variants of PI3K/AKT pathway were significantly related to RP of grade ≥ 3 and may thus be predictors of severe RP before radiotherapy, if further validated in larger population.

94	CXCL12 genetic variants as prognostic markers in nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2015	26504400	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26504400	Journal Article	Chinese Han	222	175	47	\N	\N	\N	All patients received definitive radiotherapy following established methods. The accumulated dose to primary tumor was 64-80 Gy; the accumulated dose to the involved areas of the neck was 60-62 Gy, and it was 50 Gy to the uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin with 5-fluorouracil or taxanes administered every 3 weeks for three cycles. Two-dimensional radiotherapy was administered to 208/222 (93.7%) patents, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy was administered to 14/222 (6.3%) patients.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The chemokine receptor 4/chemokine ligand 12 (CXCR4/CXCL12) axis plays an important role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and recurrence of tumors. Its single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with patient survival in several types of cancer. However, the prognostic value of SNPs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has not been fully investigated. This retrospective study assessed the relationships between CXCR4 rs2228014 and CXCL12 rs1801157 polymorphisms and patient outcome in 222 patients newly diagnosed with NPC. The analysis found no significant correlation between the presence of both SNPs and clinicopathological factors. However, univariate analysis showed that N classification, clinical stage, and the CXCL12 rs1801157 polymorphism were significantly associated with distant metastasis-free survival (P=0.018, 0.028, and 0.013, respectively) and progression-free survival (P=0.007, 0.046, and 0.021, respectively). After adjusting clinicopathological factors, multivariate analysis identified CXCL12 rs1801157 as an independent prognostic factor for distant metastasis-free survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 3.332; 95% confidence interval: 1.597-6.949; P=0.001 and hazard ratio: 2.665 95% confidence interval: 1.387-5.119; P=0.003, respectively). Our results suggest that CXCL12 rs1801157 AA genotype might serve as a potential prognostic factor in patients with NPC.	OncoTargets and Therapy	Stage I-II: 79 patients, Stage III-IV: 143 patients.
97	Tumor response is predicted by patient genetic profile in rectal cancer patients treated with neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy	English	2011	20368715	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20368715	Journal Article	\N	238	159	79	61	\N	[20.0,79.0)	In brief, patients underwent to external beam RT with a 10–18MV linear accelerator. The clinical target volume included the primary tumor, with the mesorectum, the posterior walls of the bladder and prostate/vagina, and the internal iliac nodes. A three or four-shaped field box technique was used. A radiation dose of 45-50.4Gy (according to the consecutive study protocols used in the period time considered for the analysis) was given, with a conventional fractionation of 1.8Gy per day, 5 days a week. Chemotherapy consisted of a fluoropyrimidine (mainly 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)) alone or in combination with other drugs (platinum derivatives, irinotecan or gefitinib). In a subset of patients raltitrexed was used in substitution to 5-FU (Table 1b). Variations in preoperative therapy were related to (a) the period of treatment (during the initial years of the study 5-FU bolus was used in combination with low-dose leucovorin and external beam RT, 45Gy in 25 fractions, and later 5-FU was administered by continuous venous infusion and external beam RT, 50.4Gy in 28 fractions); (b) the enrollment of patients in prospective clinical trials.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	The aim of the study was the identification of a pharmacogenetic profile predictive of the tumor regression grade (TRG), considered as tumor response parameter, after neo-adjuvant treatment in rectal cancer patients. A total of 238 rectal cancer patients treated in a neo-adjuvant setting by a fluoropyrimidines-based chemo-radiotherapy (RT) were genotyped for 25 genetic polymorphisms in 16 genes relevant for treatment-associated pathways. Two polymorphisms were associated with TRG in a multivariate analysis: hOGG1-1245C > G, which can affect radiosensitivity and MTHFR-677C > T, which is involved in fluoropyrimidines action. Patients bearing at least one variant allele had a lower chance to get TRG ≤ 2 (OR = 0.46 95% CI 0.23-0.90, P = 0.024; and OR = 0.48 95% CI 0.24-0.96, P = 0.034; respectively). An association trend was observed for ABCB1-3435C > T, which is responsible for the multi-drug resistance (odds ratio (OR) = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-3.95, P = 0.057). Exploratory classification and regression tree (CART) analysis highlighted high-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions and a genetic signature associated with differential response, with hOGG1-1245C > G as the most predictive factor. Other significant variables were: ABCB1-3435C > T, MTHFR-677C > T, ERCC1-8092C > A, ABCC2-1249G > A, XRCC1-28152G > A, XRCC3-4541A > G and patients gender. On the basis of CART results, patients were categorized into three groups according to tumor response probability: intermediate and high profiles had a higher probability to get TRG ≤ 2 as compared with low profiles (OR = 4.12 95% CI 1.46-11.65, P < 0.001 and OR = 12.44, 95% CI 5.52-28.04, P < 0.0001, respectively). This study evidences a major role of hOGG1-1245C > G and MTHFR-677C > T polymorphisms in the tumor response of rectal cancer patients treated with chemo-RT in neo-adjuvant setting, and shows the relevance of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions for complex phenotypes as tumor response.

Ljubljana, Slovenia—Patients (n=31) received capecitabine 1250 mg/㎡ twice daily for 2 weeks followed by intravenous cetuximab 400 mg/㎡ at week 3, 250 mg/㎡ cetuximab plus CRT including capecitabine 825 mg/㎡ twice daily (including weekends during radiotherapy) with radiotherapy of 45 Gy (25 × 1.8 Gy), 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Halle/Erlangen/Göttingen/Regensburg, Germany—Patients (n=42) received cetuximab given as an initial dose of 400 mg/㎡ 7 days before the start of radiotherapy (RT), and then at 250 mg/㎡ once weekly during RT (50.4 Gy, 28 × 1.8 Gy). Capecitabine and oxaliplatin were administered according to an established schedule of oxaliplatin (50 mg/㎡ on Days 1, 8, 22, and 29) and capecitabine (Days 1–14 and 22–35) at three dose levels: 1,000, 1,300, and 1,650 mg/㎡ /d. Cologne, Germany—Patients (n=16) where treated with 45 Gy of radiation (25 × 1.8 Gy) and cetuximab (400 mg/㎡ as initial dose 1 week before CRT followed by 250 mg/㎡ /wk for 5 weeks) in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Cetuximab has shown significant clinical activity in metastatic colon cancer. However, cetuximab-containing neoadjuvant chemoradiation has not been shown to improve tumor response in locally advanced rectal cancer patients in recent phase I/II trials. We evaluated functional germline polymorphisms of genes involved in epidermal growth factor receptor pathway, angiogenesis, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, DNA repair, and drug metabolism, for their potential role as molecular predictors for clinical outcome in locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative cetuximab-based chemoradiation. METHODS: 130 patients (74 men and 56 women) with locally advanced rectal cancer (4 with stage II, 109 with stage III, and 15 with stage IV, 2 unknown) who were enrolled in phase I/II clinical trials treated with cetuximab-based chemoradiation in European cancer centers were included. Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and genotyping was done by using PCR-RFLP assays. Fisher's exact test was used to examine associations between polymorphisms and complete pathologic response (pCR) that was determined by a modified Dworak classification system (grade III vs. grade IV: complete response). RESULTS: Patients with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 61 G/G genotype had pCR of 45% (5/11), compared with 21% (11/53) in patients heterozygous, and 2% (1/54) in patients homozygous for the A/A allele (P < 0.001). In addition, this association between EGF 61 G allele and pCR remained significant (P = 0.019) in the 59 patients with wild-type KRAS. CONCLUSION: This study suggested EGF A+61G polymorphism to be a predictive marker for pCR, independent of KRAS mutation status, to cetuximab-based neoadjuvant chemoradiation of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

99	X-ray cross-complementing group 1 and thymidylate synthase polymorphisms might predict response to chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer patients	English	2012	21167658	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21167658	Journal Article	\N	93	68	25	67	\N	[39.0,86.0)	The treatment consisted of radiotherapy to a total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose, 1.8 Gy delivered in28fractions) with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) as a continuous infusion of 225 mg/㎡/d. The surgery was performed 6–8 weeks after chemoradiotherapy completion using the total mesorectal excision technique. The surgical procedures included abdominoperineal resection, anterior resection, and Hartman procedure.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Purpose: 5-Fluorouracil–based chemoradiotherapy before total mesorectal excision is currently the standard treatment of Stage II and III rectal cancer patients. We used known predictive pharmacogenetic biomarkers to identify the responders to preoperative chemoradiotherapy in our series. Methods and Materials: A total of 93 Stage II-III rectal cancer patients were genotyped using peripheral blood samples. The genes analyzed were X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1), ERCC1, MTHFR, EGFR, DPYD, and TYMS. The patients were treated with 225 mg/㎡/d continuous infusion of 5-ﬂuorouracil concomitantly with radiotherapy (50.4 Gy) followed by total mesorectal excision. The outcomes were measured by tumor regression grade (TRG) as a major response (TRG 1 and TRG 2) or as a poor response (TRG3, TRG4, and TRG5). Results: The major histopathologic response rate was 47.3%. XRCC1 G/G carriers had a greater probability of response than G/A carriers (odds ratio, 4.18; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.62–10.74, p = .003) Patients with polymorphisms associated with high expression of thymidylate synthase (2R/3G, 3C/3G, and 3G/3G) showed a greater pathologic response rate compared with carriers of low expression (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.10–6.39, p = .02) No signiﬁcant differences were seen in the response according to EGFR, ERCC1, MTHFR_C677 and MTHFR_A1298 expression. Conclusions: XRCC1 G/G and thymidylate synthase (2R/3G, 3C/3G, and 3G/3G) are independent factors of a major response. Germline thymidylate synthase and XRCC1 polymorphisms might be useful as predictive markers of rectal tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 5-ﬂuorouracil.

100	EGFR ligands and DNA repair genes: genomic predictors of complete response after capecitabine-based chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2015	25026457	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026457	Journal Article	\N	84	55	29	\N	67.5999999999999943	[42.0,80.0)	The preplanned radiotherapy dose was 45 Gy given at 1.8 Gy per session, 5 days per week for 5 weeks. Concomitantly with radiotherapy, patients received capecitabine 825 mg/㎡/12h 5 days a week. Surgical resection was performed within 6–8 weeks after preoperative treatment. Adjuvant treatment was left to the discretion of the treating physician.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation by radiation leads to increased cell proliferation and acts as a radioresistance mechanism. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer, and to date, no biomarkers of response have been found. We analyzed polymorphisms in the EGFR and its ligands, DNA repair genes and the thymidylate synthase in 84 stages II and III rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant capecitabine plus radiotherapy. The rs11942466 polymorphism in the amphiregulin (AREG) gene region was associated with a pathological complete response (ypCR) (odds ratio: 0.26; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.79; P=0.014). The rs11615 C>T polymorphism in the ERCC1 gene also correlated with the ypCR as no patients with a C/C genotype achieved ypCR; P=0.023. This is the first work to propose variants within the AREG and the ERCC1 genes as promising predictive biomarkers of ypCR in rectal cancer.

101	THRB genetic polymorphisms can predict severe myelotoxicity after definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2012	23136537	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23136537	Journal Article	Japanese	49	46	3	\N	64.5	[48.0,78.0)	A course consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 400 mg/㎡/day for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP at 40 mg/㎡/day on days 1 and 8, and the radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 (a total dose of 60 Gy in 30 fractions). This schedule was repeated twice every 5 weeks. When detecting grade 3/4 hematological toxicities, chemotherapy was withheld until the blood cell counts recovered beyond the critical level, and then a reduced dose was resumed. For fever higher than grade 2, chemotherapy was withheld pending improvement. For renal toxicity, the subsequent dose of CDDP was reduced depending on the degree of toxicity. Radiotherapy was also withheld during the time when the chemotherapy was withheld for severe hematological and/or non-hematological toxicities. In principle, the total radiation dose was not reduced.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: Chemotherapy-related toxicities are difficult to predict before treatment. In this study, we investigated whether thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) genetic polymorphisms can serve as a potential biomarker in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: Forty-nine Japanese patients with ESCC who received a definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin in conjunction with concurrent irradiation were retrospectively analyzed. Severe acute toxicities, including leukopenia, stomatitis, and cheilitis, were evaluated according to 6 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene; the intronic SNPs of rs7635707 G/T, rs6787255 A/C, rs9812034 G/T, and rs9310738 C/T and the SNPs in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of rs844107 C/T and rs1349265 G/A. RESULTS: Distribution of the 4 intronic SNPs, but not the 2 SNPs in the 3'-UTR, showed a significant difference between patients with and without severe acute leukopenia. Stomatitis and cheilitis were not associated with any of the 6 analyzed SNPs. Frequency of haplotype of the 4 intronic SNPs reached approximately 97% with the 2 major haplotypes G-A-G-C (73.4%) and T-C-T-T (23.5%). CONCLUSIONS: THRB intronic SNPs can provide useful information on CRT-related severe myelotoxicity in patients with ESCC. Future studies will be needed to confirm these findings.

102	The impact of GGH -401C>T polymorphism on cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy response and survival in cervical cancer	English	2013	23107767	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107767	Journal Article	\N	167	\N	167	47	48.5799999999999983	\N	Chemotherapy regimen consisted of cisplatin (40 mg/㎡, iv) admin- istered weekly in a total of six weeks. Concurrent radiotherapy consisted of pelvic external beam radiotherapy (for a total dose of 45–50 Gy of pel- vic irradiation) and one to three intracavitary brachytherapy applications after the completion of external pelvic radiotherapy (cumulative dose at point A: 75 Gy; cumulative dose to point B: 55 Gy). For patients with lymph node metastasis, the treatment field was set to extend beyond the known extent of disease. From 167 patients evaluated for GGH-401C>T genotypes, 101 completed 6 cycles of the chemotherapy treatment. Hematological toxicity was the main factor causing treatment interruption.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIMS: Cervical cancer is the third most frequent cancer in women worldwide, mostly treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. Since it is known that folate metabolism might interfere with cisplatin effectiveness, we intended to study the influence of the Gamma Glutamyl Hydrolase -401C>T polymorphism in treatment response in cervical cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 167 patients with bulky cervical cancer submitted to cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. The genotypes of GGH -401C>T SNP were determined by real-time PCR and statistical analysis was performed by χ(2) test and survival analysis. RESULTS: The genotypes of GGH-401C>T were significantly associated with the response to platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. Treatment response was higher in patients carrying the CC genotype, who presented a significant increased chance of treatment response (survival time in months/genotype: 91 for CC Vs 72 for CT/TT; p=0.035, log rank test). A Cox regression analysis accordingly showed that the presence of the T allele was significantly linked to a worse treatment response (HR=3.036; CI 95% 1.032-8.934, p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggested the potential interest of GGH -401C>T as a predictive factor of the outcome of cervical carcinoma treated with cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy.

103	Genetic polymorphisms and treatment response in advanced non-small cell lung cancer	English	2007	17222938	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222938	Journal Article	\N	125	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms involved in DNA repair and apoptosis are suspected to influence patient response to cancer treatment. To evaluate the effect of genetic variations on chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, we genotyped four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATM (A60G), ERCC1 (Asn118Asn), APE1 (Asn148Glu), and iASPP (A67T), and examined their associations with treatment response among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Included in the study were 230 patients diagnosed with inoperable advanced NSCLC. Of these patients, 76 received platinum-based chemotherapy, 125 received chemotherapy plus radiation, and 29 received radiotherapy only. The SNPs were genotyped using the TaqMan methods. RESULTS: Among the patients who received chemotherapy only, ERCC1 (Asn118Asn) genotype was significantly associated with treatment response. Patients with either one or two T alleles (T/T+C/T) at Asn118Asn were more likely not to respond to platinum-based chemotherapy compared to those without the T allele (OR=4.10, 95% CI: 1.31-12.85). For patients who were treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, treatment response seemed to differ substantially between patients with different genotypes of iASPP (A67T). Patients carrying an A allele (A/T+A/A) at A67T were more likely to respond to combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared to those not carrying the A allele (OR=0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.74). An association with treatment response was also suggested for the selected polymorphism in APE1, but no association was found for the ATM polymorphism. CONCLUSION: We found that SNPs in ERCC1 and iASPP were associated with response to chemotherapy or combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy in NSCLC patients. These findings support the notion that genetic variations related to DNA repair or apoptosis may affect the effect of chemotherapy or radiation on NSCLC.	Lung Cancer	\N

Pelvic irradiation was given as a dose of 45 Gy to the whole pelvis and an additional boost up to a total of 54 Gy (range 50.4–54). During radiation, patients received 5-FU either as a 4-day infusion (1000 mg/㎡) at the beginning and end of radiation treatment, or as a daily continuous infusion (200 mg/㎡).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Stage II and III adenocarcinoma of the rectum has an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%, and tumor recurrence remains a major problem despite an improvement in local control through chemotherapy and radiation. The efficacy of chemoradiation therapy may be significantly compromised as a result of interindividual variations in clinical response and host toxicity. Therefore, it is imperative to identify those patients who will benefit from chemoradiation therapy and those who will develop recurrent disease. In this study, we tested whether a specific pattern of 21 polymorphisms in 18 genes involved in the critical pathways of cancer progression (i.e., drug metabolism, tumor microenvironment, cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair) will predict the risk of tumor recurrence in rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients with Stage II or III rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques for 21 polymorphisms. RESULTS: A polymorphism in interleukin (IL)-8 was individually associated with risk of recurrence. Classification and regression tree analysis of all polymorphisms and clinical variables developed a risk tree including the following variables: node status, IL-8, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, transforming growth factor-beta, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. CONCLUSION: Genomic profiling may help to identify patients who are at high risk for developing tumor recurrence, and those who are more likely to benefit from chemoradiation therapy. A larger prospective study is needed to validate these preliminary data using germline polymorphisms on tumor recurrences in rectal cancer patients treated with chemoradiation.

105	Pharmacogenetic analysis in neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer: high incidence of somaticmutations and their relation with response	English	2010	20504250	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20504250	Journal Article	\N	65	50	15	64	\N	[37.0,85.0)	The patients received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 225 mg/㎡/day continuous infusion or capecitabine 825 mg/㎡ twice daily during weeks 1–5, along the fractionated radiotherapy schedule (1.89 Gy per day, 50.49 Gy over the whole treatment). The surgery was carried out 6–8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy using the total mesorectal excision (TME) technique.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIMS: The identification of predictive markers of response to chemoradiotherapy treatment remains a promising approach for patient management in order to obtain the best response with minor side effects. Initially, we investigated whether the analysis of several markers previously studied and others not yet evaluated could predict response to 5-fluorouracil- and capecitabine-based neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS & MATERIALS: We studied germline and tumoral samples of 65 stage II/III rectal patients. A panel of pharmacogenetic markers was genotyped in paired peripheral blood samples and rectal cancer tumors. RESULTS: Our results seem to confirm the previously described association of thymidylate synthase and the prediction of chemoradiotherapy response in rectal cancer. However, it failed to confirm the clinical utility proposed for XRCC1, ERCC1, ERCC2, MTHFR and EGFR polymorphisms in blood/germline samples. Subsequently, with the aim of improving prediction of individual response and assessing the role of studied polymorphisms in response to treatment, we determined if changes in tumor response to these markers could predict clinical outcome. We found a high degree of changes between germline and tumor samples, mainly somatic mutations without microsatellite instability, and a minor frequency of loss-of-heterozygosity events. In tumoral samples, XRCC1 appeared to be significantly associated (p = 0.006) with downstaging of the tumor (odds ratio: 7.93; 95% CI: 1.03-60.83), but the increasing of TYMS low-expression alleles contradict the previous results observed in germline samples. CONCLUSION: The detection of somatic mutations in rectal cancer tumors led us to re-evaluate the utility of the tests performed in blood samples for these polymorphisms in rectal cancer. Furthermore, studies aimed at assessing the influence of pharmacogenetic markers in treatment response performed in blood samples should take into account the particular pattern of hypermutability present in each tumor type. We hypothesize that different patterns of hypermutability present in each tumor type would be related to the different results in association studies related to response to the treatment.

This chemotherapy regimen developed by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group was used before and after radiation. Chemotherapy (fluorouracil, 425 mg/㎡ per day, and leucovorin, 20 mg/㎡ per day) was initiated on d 1 followed by chemoradiotherapy on d 28 after the initial cycle of chemotherapy. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of 4500 cGy of radiation at 180 cGy/d, 5 d/wk for 5 wk, with 5-FU (400 mg/㎡ per day) and leucovorin (20 mg/㎡ per day) on the first four and the last three days of radiotherapy. One month after radiotherapy, two 5-d cycles of 5-FU (425 mg/㎡ per day) plus leucovorin (20 mg/㎡ per day) were given every other month. The 4500 cGy of radiation was delivered in 25 fractions (5 d/wk) to the tumor bed, regional nodes and 2 cm beyond the proximal and distal margins of resection. The adjuvant treatment was performed as previously described.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: To evaluate the potential association of xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) codon 751 variant with outcome after chemo-radiotherapy in patients with resected gastric cancer. METHODS: We used PCR-RFLP to evaluate the genetic XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms in 44 patients with stage III (48%) and IV (20%) gastric cancer treated with surgery following radiation therapy plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin based chemotherapy. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that 75% (12 of 16) of relapse patients showed Lys/Lys genotype more frequently (P = 0.042). The Lys polymorphism was an independent predictor of high-risk relapse-free survival from Cox analysis (HR: 3.07, 95% CI: 1.07-8.78, P = 0.036) and Kaplan-Meir test (P = 0.027, log-rank test). CONCLUSION: XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism may be an important marker in the prediction of clinical outcome to chemo-radiotherapy in resected gastric cancer patients.

Initially, 23 fractions, 1.8 Gy given once daily 5 days per week, were delivered to a total dose of 41.4 Gy. The initial radiation ﬁeld encompassed a volume that included the ipsilateral hilum, bilateral mediastinal lymph nodal station with a 1.5-cm margin, the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa, and the pri- mary mass with a 1.5–2-cm margin in patients who received deﬁnitive radiotherapy. If the postoperative T stage was T1 or T2, the radiation ﬁeld in patients with postoperative radiotherapy did not encompass the primary tumor bed. During the initial course of the 41.4 Gy of radiotherapy, CT simulation (AcQSim, Marconi, Coventry, England) was performed to reduce the radiation ﬁeld. After the target volumes and critical normal organs were drawn, the images were then transferred to a 3D planning system (Render plan, Elekta, Stockholm, Sweden). Three- to seven-ﬁeld coplanar and/or noncoplanar beams were used to deliver the booster radi- ation dose. A total dose of 50.4 Gy was delivered to the patients who had received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy, and a dose of 65–70 Gy was delivered to the patients who had received deﬁnitive radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The X-ray repair cross-complementing Group 1 (XRCC1) protein is involved mainly in the base excision repair of the DNA repair process. This study examined the association of 3 polymorphisms (codon 194, 280, and 399) of XRCC1 and lung cancer in terms of whether or not these polymorphisms have an effect on the survival of lung cancer patients who have received radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 2000 and April 2004, 229 lung cancer patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in Stages I-III were enrolled. Genotyping was performed by single base primer extension assay using the SNP-IT Kit with genomic DNA samples from all patients. The haplotype of the XRCC1 polymorphisms was estimated by PHASE version 2.1. RESULTS: The patients consisted of 191 (83.4%) males and 38 (16.6%) females with a median age of 62 (range, 26-88 years). Sixty percent of the patients were included in Stage I-IIIa. The median progression-free and overall survival was 13 months and 16 months, respectively. The XRCC1 codon 194, histology, and stage were shown to be significant predictors of the progression-free survival. The 6 haplotypes among the XRCC1 polymorphisms (194, 280, and 399) were estimated by PHASE v.2.1. The patients with haplotype pairs other than the homozygous TGG haplotype pairs survived significantly longer (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms of XRCC1 have an effect on the survival of lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy, and this effect seems to be more significant after the haplotype pairs are considered.

Patients in the ID01-341 trial (n = 65) had received induction therapy of gemcitabine (750 mg/㎡/d) and cisplatin (30 mg/㎡/d) every 2 wk for 4 wk and radiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 wk.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The goals of this study were to determine if single-nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA damage repair genes and cell cycle regulating genes affect clinical response to combined gemcitabine radiation therapy and the overall survival (OS) of patients with pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated six single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the ATM, ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), CHEK1, and CHEK2 genes in 119 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic cancer who were enrolled in clinical trials at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from February 1999 to January 2006, with follow-up until February 2007. Patients received neoadjuvant concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy with or without gemcitabine-cisplatin induction therapy. Genotypes were determined and tested for associations with OS by Kaplan-Meier estimation, the log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis. P values of <or=0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The ATM G60A and CHEK1 G35A genotypes were significant (P<0.05), and the ATR C340T genotype borderline significantly (P=0.079) associated with OS. The hazard ratio of CHEK1 35AA was 2.01 (95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.37; P=0.007) compared with CHEK1 35GG/GA with adjustments for race, sex, diabetes status, CA19-9 level, and success of tumor resection. A significant combined genotype effect was observed between ATM 60GA/GG, ATR 340CT/CC, and CHEK1 35AA with median OS times of 31.0, 16.2, and 10.5 months for patients carrying <or=1, 2, and 3 deleterious alleles, respectively (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that polymorphic variations of DNA damage response genes affect clinical response to gemcitabine radiation therapy and OS of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.

Glioblastomas frequently show genetic alterations in the TP53 pathway. In the present study, we assessed MDM2 SNP309 in 360 glioblastomas, and correlated these with patient age and survival, as well as other alterations in the TP53 pathway. Frequencies of the MDM2 SNP309 T/T, T/G and G/G genotypes in glioblastomas were 40%, 46% and 14%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that MDM2 SNP309 G/G allele was significantly associated with favorable outcome in female glioblastoma patients (hazard ratio 0.54; 95% CI = 0.32-0.92). There was a significant association between MDM2 SNP309 G alleles and TP53 codon 72 Pro/Pro in glioblastomas. Glioblastoma patients with TP53 codon 72 Pro/Pro genotype were significantly younger than Arg/Arg carriers (mean 50.2 vs. 56.1 years; P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis showed that those with TP53 codon 72 Arg/Pro allele had significantly shorter survival than those with Arg/Arg allele (hazard ratio 1.35; 95% CI = 1.07-1.71). Detailed analyses revealed that TP53 codon 72 Pro allele was significantly associated with shorter survival among patients with glioblastomas carrying a TP53 mutation, and among those treated with surgery plus radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The breast cancer incidence has been increasing in the south Indian women. A case (n=250)-control (n=500) study was undertaken to investigate the role of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP's) in GSTM1 (Present/Null); GSTP1 (Ile105Val), p53 (Arg72Pro), TGFbeta1 (Leu10Pro), c-erbB2 (Ile655Val), and GSTT1 (Null/Present) in breast cancer. In addition, the value of the SNP's in predicting primary tumor's pathologic response following neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy was assessed. Genotyping was done using PCR (GSTM1, GSTT1), Taqman Allelic discrimination assay (GSTP1, c-erbB2) and PCR-CTPP (p53 and TGFbeta1). None of the gene SNP's studied were associated with a statistically significant increased risk for the breast cancer. However, combined analysis of the SNP's showed that p53 (Arg/Arg and Arg/Pro) with TGFbeta1 (Pro/Pro and Leu/Pro) were associated with greater than 2 fold increased risk for breast cancer in Univariate (P=0.01) and Multivariate (P=0.003) analysis. There was no statistically significant association for the GST family members with the breast cancer risk. TGFbeta1 (Pro/Pro) allele was found to predict complete pathologic response in the primary tumour following neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (OR=6.53 and 10.53 in Univariate and Multivariate analysis respectively) (P=0.004) and was independent of stage. This study suggests that SNP's can help predict breast cancer risk in south Indian women and that TGFbeta1 (Pro/Pro) allele is associated with a better pCR in the primary tumour.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Genetic polymorphisms play an important role in clinical response to cytotoxic therapies. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in cell cycle genes may modulate response to preoperative chemoradiation and survival of pancreatic cancer patients. We evaluated 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ten cell cycle genes in 88 patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head who were treated with neoadjuvant concurrent gemcitabine and radiotherapy. Response was assessed by computerized tomography obtained before and 4-6 weeks after preoperative treatment. Time to tumor progression and survival after treatment were measured. Patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) if no disease progression was found at restaging after preoperative therapy. MDM2 T309G and p16 C580T genotype distributions were significantly different in the patients who underwent PD and those who did not (P = 0.025 for MDM2; P = 0.016 for p16). The MDM2 and p27 genotypes had a significant effect on survival times after treatment (log-rank test, P = 0.010 and P = 0.050, respectively). A strong joint effect of these two genes was observed (log-rank test, P = 0.010). The p73 and p16 polymorphic genotypes were significantly associated with shorter time to tumor progression (log-rank test, P = 0.021 and P = 0.039, respectively). A gene-dosage effect on time to tumor progression was observed for polymorphisms in the p73, p16, and MDM2 genes. The hazard ratios for patients with one, two, or three adverse genotypes were 2.13 (1.04-4.36), 3.18 (1.37-7.39), and 10.09 (3.17-32.05), respectively. These findings suggest these polymorphisms in the cell cycle genes are promising prognostic markers for patients with pancreatic cancer.	Annals of Surgical Oncology	\N

Three cycles of chemotherapy (CRT) were performed where possible; the treatment was halted in patients who received one or two cycles of therapy and showed persistent side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or pancytopenia for 2 weeks, or who refused to continue with CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as bladder conservation therapy has shown promising results for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, CRT might diminish survival as a result of the delay in cystectomy for some patients with non-responding bladder tumors. Because the p53 tumor suppression pathway, including its MDM2 counterpart, is important in chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-associated effects, functional polymorphisms in the TP53 and MDM2 genes could influence the response to treatment and the prognosis following CRT. We investigated associations between two such polymorphisms, and p53 overexpression, and response or survival in bladder cancer patients treated with CRT. The study group comprised 96 patients who underwent CRT for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TP53 (codon 72, arginine > proline) and MDM2 (SNP309, T > G) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP, and nuclear expression levels of p53 were examined using immunohistochemistry. None of the genotypes or p53 overexpression was significantly associated with response to CRT. However, patients with MDM2 T / G + G / G genotypes had improved cancer-specific survival rates after CRT (P = 0.009). In multivariate analysis, the MDM2 T / G + G / G genotypes, and more than two of total variant alleles in TP53 and MDM2, were independently associated with improved cancer-specific survival (P = 0.031 and P = 0.015, respectively). In addition, MDM2 genotypes were significantly associated with cystectomy-free survival (P = 0.030). These results suggest that the TP53 and MDM2 genotypes might be useful prognostic factors following CRT in bladder cancer, helping patient selection for bladder conservation therapy.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Currently definitive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin (CDDP) -based chemotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising treatments for esophageal cancer. A series of studies performed found genetic polymorphisms and the plasma concentration of 5-FU to be predictive of acute severe toxicities and clinical response. Genetic polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and its surface receptors, TNFRSF1A and TNFRSF1B have been examined in terms of susceptibility to various cancers. In this study, genetic polymorphisms of TNFRSF1B gene were evaluated Japanese esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients treated with the definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based chemoradiotherapy and their predictive values of prognosis or severe acute toxicities were assessed. METHODS: Forty-six patients with ESCC were treated with the definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based chemoradiotherapy, one course of which consisted of the continuous infusion of 5-FU for days 1-5 and 8-12, the infusion of CDDP on days 1 and 8, and the radiation at 2 Gy/day on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19, with a second course repeated after 2-week interval. Genetic polymorphisms of a TNF-alpha receptor TNFRSF1B gene were determined by a TaqMan(R) MGB probe-based polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The genotype of TNFSR1B A1466G, but not M196R/T587G or C1493T, was found to be predictive of clinical response, i.e., a complete response or not (p = 0.040). Clinical response was predicted by tumor size (p = 0,002), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.007), distant metastasis (p = 0.001) and disease stage (p < 0.001), but TNFRSF1B A1466G genotype was independent of these factors. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphism of TNFRSF1B A1466G was found to be predictive response in Japanese ESCC patients with a definitive 5-FU/CDDP-based chemoradiotherapy. Further clinical investigation with a large number of patients or experiments in vitro should be performed to assess the predictive value of TNFRSF1B A1466G genotype after chemoradiotherapy.

125	Association between polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes, XRCC1, APE1, and XPD and acute side effects of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients	English	2005	16000577	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000577	Journal Article	Caucasian	446	\N	446	\N	60.2999999999999972	\N	We conducted a prospective study of 446 female patients with breast cancer who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. All the patients were given a common breast radiation treatment including CT-based planning, simulation, verification, and quality assurance and received conformal tangential irradiation with lateral and medial wedge fields. The standard radiotherapy regime included irradiation of the whole breast followed by an electron boost at three radiology departments, either 50 Gy given in 5x2.0 Gy fractions per week or 50.4 Gy in 5x1.8 Gy fractions per week. In the fourth radiology department, 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation were applied in 5x2.0 Gy fractions per week without an electron boost.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Several DNA repair gene polymorphisms have been described, which affect DNA repair capacity and modulate cancer susceptibility. We evaluated the association of six polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes: XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln), APE1 (Asp148Glu), and XPD (Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn), with the risk of acute skin reactions following radiotherapy. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study of 446 female patients with breast cancer who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. Individual genetic polymorphisms were determined using melting point analysis of sequence-specific hybridization probes. The development of acute skin reactions (moist desquamation) associated with DNA repair gene polymorphisms was modeled using Cox proportional hazards, accounting for cumulative biologically effective radiation dose. RESULTS: Overall, the development of acute toxicity, which presented in 77 patients, was not associated with the genetic variants studied, although the hazard ratios (HR) were generally below 1. Risks were however differential by body mass index. Among normal-weight patients only, both carriers of the APE1 148Glu and the XRCC1 399Gln alleles had decreased risk of acute skin reactions after radiotherapy (HR, 0.49 and 0.51, respectively). The results for XRCC1 were confirmed by haplotype analysis. When considering joint effects, we observed that compared with homozygote carriers of the wild-type allele in both genes, the risk was most strongly reduced in carriers of both APE1 148Glu and XRCC1 399Gln alleles with normal weight [HR, 0.19; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.06-0.56] but not in those with overweight (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.56-3.45; Pinteraction = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The XRCC1 399Gln or APE1 148Glu alleles may be protective against the development of acute side effects after radiotherapy in patients with normal weight.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

We investigated the association between 2 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the coding region of STK15, T91A (Phe31Ile) and G169A (Val57Ile), and clinical outcome of esophageal cancer treated with preoperative chemoradiation. METHODS: Genotypes at Phe31Ile and Val57Ile were assessed from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 190 esophageal cancer patients and were correlated to response to treatment, recurrence rate, risk of death, disease-free survival (DFS) and median survival time (MTS). RESULTS: All patients had resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer and received preoperative chemoradiation followed by esophagectomy. The heterozygous variant Phe31/Ile variant was significantly associated with tumor recurrence (odds ratio [OR] = 4.39; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.12-8.94; P < .001), shorter DFS (P = .0001), and shorter MTS (P = .012). For patients receiving cisplatin-based therapy, only the variant Phe31/Ile had an adverse effect on response (OR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.01-5.17; P = .048) and MTS (P = .026). The variant 91A-169G haplotype carried a significant risk for lack of complete response (OR = 2.54; 95% CI, 1.15-5.54) and higher rate of recurrence (OR = 2.73; 95%CI, 1.00-7.29). The presence of at least 1 variant allele at each locus further increased the risk of recurrence (adjusted OR = 6.21; 95% CI, 2.28-17.11; P = <.001), and was associated significantly shorter DFS (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that functional SNPs in the STK15 gene are associated with higher rate of recurrence, higher likelihood of chemoratiotherapy-resistance, shorter DFS, and shorter MTS. Confirmation of our data and understanding the mechanisms through which STK15 functional SNPs mediate resistance to chemoradiotherapy are warranted.

115	Validation of genetic sequence variants as prognostic factors in early-stage head and neck squamous cell cancer survival	English	2012	22076708	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22076708	Journal Article	\N	531	420	111	63	\N	[33.0,86.0)	All 531 patients with stage I and Ⅱ radiation-treated head and neck cancers were from an NCI-Canada–funded, randomized secondary prevention trial of alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene supplementation from 1994 to 2000 at 5 different radiation treatment centers in Qu ebec, Canada.	Radiotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: From the published literature, we identified 23 germ line sequence variants in 17 genes from hypothesis-generating studies that were associated with prognosis of head and neck cancer, including sequence variants of DNA repair (ERCC1, ERCC4, ERCC5, MSH2, XPA, ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3), DNA methylation (DNMT3B), cell cycle and proliferation (CCND1, TP53), xenobiotic metabolism (GSTM1, GSTT1, CYP2D6), metastatic -potential (MMP3), immunologic (CTLA4), and growth factor pathways (FGFR4). The purpose of this study was to validate the role of these 23 sequence variants for overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in a large, comprehensive, well-annotated data set of patients with head and neck cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We genotyped these sequence variants in 531 patients with stage I and II radiation-treated head and neck cancer (originally recruited for an alpha-tocopherol/beta-carotene placebo-controlled secondary prevention study), and analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by treatment arm, adjusting for clinical prognostic factors. RESULTS: Two OS associations were statistically significant for each variant allele when compared with the wild-type: CTLA4: A49G [rs231775; adjusted HR (aHR), 1.32 (1.1-1.6); P = 0.01] and XRCC1: Arg339Gln [rs25487; aHR, 1.28 (1.05-1.57); P = 0.02]. Both of these sequence variants had significant results in the opposite direction as prior published literature. Two DFS associations were of borderline significance in the same direction as prior literature: ERCC2: Lys751Gln [rs13181; aHR, 0.80 (0.6-1.0); P = 0.05] and TP53: Arg72Pro [rs1042522; aHR, 1.28 (1.0-1.6); P = 0.03], comparing number of variant alleles with reference of zero variants. CONCLUSIONS: None of the prognostic sequence variants previously published was validated for OS in our patients with early-stage radiation-treated head and neck cancer, though rs1381and rs1042522 had borderline significant association with DFS.

117	Acute toxicity of radiochemotherapy in rectal cancer patients: a risk particularly for carriers of the TGFB1 Pro25 variant	English	2012	22000747	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22000747	Journal Article	\N	163	110	53	63	\N	\N	In all patients, we applied three-dimensional-planned irradiation with 20-MV photons. The daily fraction size was 1.8 Gy (ﬁve times/ week), and the total dose was 50.4 Gy. Chemotherapy consisted of either 5-FU alone or 5-FU in combination with oxaliplatin.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor-beta1 is related to adverse events in radiochemotherapy. We investigated TGFB1 genetic variability in relation to quality of life-impairing acute organ toxicity (QAOT) of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy under clinical trial conditions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two independent patient cohorts (n = 88 and n = 75) diagnosed with International Union Against Cancer stage II/III rectal cancer received neoadjuvant radiation doses of 50.4 Gy combined with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. Toxicity was monitored according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. QAOT was defined as a CTCAE grade ≥2 for at least one case of enteritis, proctitis, cystitis, or dermatitis. Nine germline polymorphisms covering the common genetic diversity in the TGFB1 gene were genotyped. RESULTS: In both cohorts, all patients carrying the TGFB1 Pro25 variant experienced QAOT (positive predictive value of 100%, adjusted p = 0.0006). In a multivariate logistic regression model, gender, age, body mass index, type of chemotherapy, or disease state had no significant impact on QAOT. CONCLUSION: The TGFB1 Pro25 variant could be a relevant marker for individual treatment stratification and carriers may benefit from adaptive clinical care or specific radiation techniques.

118	Genetic variation in DNA-repair pathways and response to radiochemotherapy in esophageal adenocarcinoma: a retrospective cohort study of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group	English	2011	21586140	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21586140	Journal Article	\N	60	\N	\N	57	\N	[38.0,76.0)	Subjects in both arms received radiotherapy to 45 Gy administered at 1.8 Gy per day, 5 days per week for 5 weeks, concurrently with che- motherapy. One arm received cisplatin 30 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 22, 29, and irinotecan 65 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 22, 29. The other arm received cisplatin 30 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and paclitaxel 50 mg/㎡ (1 hr) days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Subjects in both arms underwent surgical resection approximately 5 weeks after the completion of radiochemotherapy (RCT).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Recent data in esophageal cancer suggests the variant allele of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in XRCC1 may be associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy. However, this SNP has not been assessed in a histologically homogeneous clinical trial cohort that has been treated with a uniform approach. In addition, whether germline DNA may serve as a surrogate for tumor genotype at this locus is unknown in this disease. Our objective was to assess this SNP in relation to the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin-based preoperative radiochemotherapy in a multicenter clinical trial (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1201). As a secondary aim, we investigated the rate of allelic imbalance between germline and tumor DNA. METHODS: Eighty-one eligible treatment-naïve subjects with newly diagnosed resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma received radiotherapy (45 Gy) concurrent with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, with planned subsequent surgical resection. The primary endpoint was pCR, defined as complete absence of tumor in the surgical specimen after radiochemotherapy. Using germline DNA from 60 subjects, we examined the base-excision repair SNP, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, and 4 other SNPs in nucleotide excision (XPD Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn, ERCC1 3' flank) and double-stranded break (XRCC2 5' flank) repair pathways, and correlated genotype with pCR rate. Paired tumor tissue was used to estimate the frequency of allelic imbalance at the XRCC1 SNP. RESULTS: The variant allele of the XRCC1 SNP (399Gln) was detected in 52% of subjects. Only 6% of subjects with the variant allele experienced a pCR, compared to 28% of subjects without the variant allele (odds ratio 5.37 for failing to achieve pCR, p = 0.062). Allelic imbalance at this locus was found in only 10% of informative subjects, suggesting that germline genotype may reflect tumor genotype at this locus. No significant association with pCR was noted for other SNPs. CONCLUSIONS: Assessed for the first time in a prospective, interventional trial cohort of esophageal adenocarcinoma, XRCC1 399Gln was associated with resistance to radiochemotherapy. Further investigation of this genetic variation is warranted in larger cohorts. In addition, these data indicate that germline genotype may serve as a surrogate for tumor genotype at this locus.

119	Glucose metabolism gene polymorphisms and clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer	English	2011	20845477	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20845477	Journal Article	\N	154	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	154 patients with resectable tumor who were enrolled in clinical trials of preoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Altered glucose metabolism is the most common metabolic hallmark of malignancies. The authors tested the hypothesis that glucose metabolism gene variations affect clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The authors retrospectively genotyped 26 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 5 glucose metabolism genes in 154 patients with localized disease and validated the findings in 552 patients with different stages of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Association between genotypes and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression models with adjustment for clinical predictors. RESULTS: Glucokinase (GCK) IVS1 + 9652C > T and hexokinase 2 (HK2) N692N homozygous variants were significantly associated with reduced OS in the training set of 154 patients (P < .001). These associations were confirmed in the validation set of 552 patients and in the combined dataset of all 706 patients (P ≤ .001). In addition, HK2 R844K variant K allele was associated with a better survival in the validation set and the combined dataset (P ≤ .001). When data were further analyzed by disease stage, glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase (GFPT1) IVS14-3094T>C, HK2 N692N and R844K in patients with localized disease and GCK IVS1 + 9652C>T in patients with advanced disease were significant independent predictors for OS (P ≤ .001). Haplotype CGG of GPI and GCTATGG of HK2 were associated with better OS, respectively, with P values of .004 and .007. CONCLUSIONS: The authors demonstrated that glucose metabolism gene polymorphisms affect clinical outcome in pancreatic cancer. These observations support a role of abnormal glucose metabolism in pancreatic carcinogenesis.	Cancer	\N
199	Germline glutathione S-transferase variants in breast cancer: relation to diagnosis and cutaneous long-term adverse effects after two fractionation patterns of radiotherapy	English	2007	17336217	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17336217	Journal Article	Norwegian	272	\N	272	\N	\N	[26.0,75.0)	As a result, 253 patients were included, with 156 undergoing treatment A (4.3 Gy in 10 fractions) and 97 undergoing treatment B (2.5 Gy in 20 fractions). Of these, 5 women (1 given treatment A and 4 given treatment B) had inoperable tumors and underwent RT to shrink the tumor for surgery. The remaining 248 women (155 in treatment A group and 93 in treatment B group) underwent postoperative RT.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To explore whether certain glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer or the level of radiation-induced adverse effects after two fractionation patterns of adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The prevalence of germline polymorphic variants in GSTM1, GSTP1, and GSTT1 was determined in 272 breast cancer patients and compared with that in a control group of 270 women from the general population with no known history of breast cancer. The genetic variants were determined using multiplex polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme fragment analysis. In 253 of the patients surveyed for radiotherapy-induced side effects after a median observation time of 13.7 years (range, 7-22.8 years), the genotypes were related to the long-term effects observed after two fractionation patterns (treatment A, 4.3 Gy in 10 fractions for 156 patients; and treatment B, 2.5 Gy in 20 fractions for 97; both administered within a 5-week period). RESULTS: None of the GST polymorphisms conferred an increased risk of breast cancer, either alone or in combination. Compared with treatment B, treatment A was followed by an increased level of moderate to severe radiation-induced side effects for all the endpoints studied (i.e., degree of telangiectasia, subcutaneous fibrosis and atrophy, lung fibrosis, costal fractures, and pleural thickening; p <0.001 for all endpoints). A significant association was found between the level of pleural thickening and the GSTP1 Ile105Val variant. CONCLUSION: The results of this study have illustrated the impact of hypofractionation on the level of adverse effects and indicated that the specific alleles of GSTP1, M1, and T1 studied here may be significant in determining the level of adverse effects after radiotherapy.

120	Genotypes and haplotypes of the VEGF gene and survival in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy	English	2010	20712888	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20712888	Journal Article	Caucasian	124	67	57	\N	\N	[35.0,88.0)	All patients received radiotherapy, delivered as 1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction once a day with a total median radiation dose of 66 Gy (ranging between 50 and 72 Gy). A number of 112 (90.3%) patients also received platinum plus taxane or etoposide-based chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of angiogenesis involving in carcinogenesis, including lung cancer. We hypothesized that VEGF polymorphisms may affect survival outcomes among locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) patients. METHODS: We genotyped three potentially functional VEGF variants [-460 T > C (rs833061), -634 G > C (rs2010963), and +936 C > T (rs3025039)] and estimated haplotypes in 124 Caucasian patients with LA-NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy. We used Kaplan-Meier log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association between VEGF variants and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Gender, Karnofsky's performance scores (KPS) and clinical stage seemed to influence the OS. The variant C genotypes were independently associated with significantly improved OS (CT+CC vs. TT: adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.37-0.92, P = 0.022), compared with the VEGF -460 TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that VEGF -460 C genotypes may be associated with a better survival of LA-NSCLC patients after chemoradiotherapy. Large studies are needed to confirm our findings.

121	Association between normal tissue complications after radiotherapy and polymorphic variations in TGFB1 and XRCC1 genes	English	2010	20334523	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20334523	Journal Article	\N	60	52	8	50	\N	[18.0,77.0)	The treatment was standardized and involved definitive radiotherapy with no surgery. In addition, patients with locally advanced stages (Ⅱ to ⅣB, n=30) received neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy consisting of cisplatinum and epirubicin. The total radiation dose to the upper neck was 66 Gy delivered using 2 Gy per fraction per day over 6.5 weeks using a 6 MV photon linear accelerator. Where possible, some patients (n=18) received a boost of two additional fractions to the nasopharynx to bring the dose received to 70 Gy in 7 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Genetic predictive biomarkers of radiosensitivity are being sought to individualize radiation treatment of cancer patients. In this pilot case-control study, we tested the association between TGFB1 T869C codon 10 Leu/Pro (rs1982073), XRCC1 G28152A codon 399 Arg/Gln (rs25487), and XRCC3 C18067T codon 241 Thr/Met (rs861539) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and late reaction to radiotherapy in 60 nasopharyngeal cancer patients. Subcutaneous and deep tissue fibrosis was scored using the RTOG/EORTC grading system. Patients with moderate to severe fibrosis (radiosensitive cases, G2-3, n = 30) were matched and compared to those with little or no reaction (controls, G0-1, n = 30). The three nonsynonymous SNPs were genotyped by direct DNA sequencing. Significant association was observed for TGFB1 T869C and XRCC1 G28152A genotypes (P < or = 0.05). Both variant alleles, TGFB1 869C and XRCC1 28152A, were associated with a lower grade of fibrosis (odds ratios were 0.41, 95% CI: 0.20-0.86, P = 0.02 and 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.89, P = 0.02, respectively), and therefore the wild-types were the risk alleles. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in the median number of risk alleles between the radiosensitive and the control groups (P = 0.006). We conclude that radiotherapy complications are associated with genetic variations in our nasopharynx cancer patients. Our findings support the assumption of the combined effects of multiple SNPs. Large-scale studies are required to confirm these findings before polymorphisms can be used as predictive markers to individualize radiation therapy on genetic bases.

122	Cyclooxygenase-2 genetic variants are associated with survival in unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer	English	2010	20332326	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20332326	Journal Article	\N	136	115	21	60	\N	[26.0,83.0)	All the patients underwent thoracic radiation with or without platinum-based chemotherapy. A total dose of 40 to 70 Gy was given with 2 Gy per fraction, 5 d weekly. In fact, the original dose prescription was no less than 60 Gy. However, there were four patients whose actual dose prescriptions were below 60 Gy. The detailed information was as follows: two patients received <60 Gy (40 and 50 Gy, respectively) because of severe radiation-induced pneumonitis and two patients received 50 Gy because of progressive disease during radiation.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays important roles in the modulation of apoptosis, angiogenesis, immune response, and tumor invasion. Elevated COX-2 expression has been reported to be correlated with reduced survival after radiotherapy. This study examined whether genetic variations in the COX-2 gene are associated with different survival in inoperable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: One hundred and thirty-six patients with inoperable stage IIIA-B NSCLC receiving thoracic irradiation between 2004 and 2007 were recruited in this study. Five functional COX-2 polymorphisms were genotyped using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to compare survival by different genotypes. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify independently significant variables. RESULTS: During the median 22.4 months of follow-up, the favorable COX-2 -1195GA and GG genotypes were significantly correlated with better overall survival (20.2 months versus 15.7 months; P = 0.006; hazard ratio (HR), 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-0.86) and with longer progress-free survival (11.9 months versus 9.5 months; P = 0.034) compared with the -1195AA genotype. No significant associations were found among other COX-2 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, COX-2 -1195G/A polymorphism was independently associated with overall survival after adjusting the clinicopathologic factors (P = 0.008; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39-0.87). CONCLUSION: COX-2 -1195G/A polymorphism is a potential predictive marker of survival in locally advanced NSCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone.

Patients in the ID01–341 trial (n = 84) received induction therapy of gemcitabine (750 mg/㎡/d) and cisplatin (30mg/㎡/d) every 2 weeks for 4 weeks and radiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) for 2 weeks with weekly gemcitabine.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To show whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of drug metabolic genes were associated with toxicity of 2',2'-difluoro 2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine)-based chemoradiotherapy and overall survival (OS) of patients with pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated 17 SNPs of the CDA, dCK, DCTD, RRM1, hCNT1, hCNT2, hCNT3, and hENT1 genes in 154 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who were enrolled in clinical trials at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) from February 1999 to January 2006, with follow-up until April 2009. Patients received neoadjuvant concurrent gemcitabine and radiation therapy with or without gemcitabine-cisplatin induction therapy. The association of genotypes with toxicity or OS was tested, respectively, by logistic regression and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: None of the 17 SNPs, individually, had a significant association with OS. A combined genotype effect of CDA A-76C, dCK C-1205T, DCTD T-47C, hCNT3 C-69T, hENT1 T-549C, and hENT1 C913T on OS was observed. Patients carrying 0 to 1 (n = 43), 2 to 3 (n = 77), or 4 to 6 (n = 30) variant alleles had median survival time of 31.5, 21.4, and 17.5 months, respectively. The hazard ratio of dying was 1.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.76) and 3.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.77-5.63) for patients carrying two to three or four to six at-risk genotypes (P = 0.028 and P < 0.001), respectively, after adjusting for clinical predictors. CDA C111T, dCK C-1205T, dCK A9846G, and hCNT3 A25G, individually and jointly, had a significant association with neutropenia toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that polymorphic variations of drug metabolic genes were associated with toxicity of gemcitabine-based therapy and OS of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.

124	MCP-1 Promoter Polymorphism at 2518 is associated with metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after treatment	English	2007	17975143	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17975143	Journal Article	\N	411	308	103	47.6300000000000026	48.7000000000000028	\N	All enrolled patients had been treated with definitive radiotherapy (cumulative dose of external beam radiotherapy ≥64.8 Gy). Among them, 109 patients received additional chemotherapy in the Department of Radiation Oncology at CGMH.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: We herein examined whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -2518 of the MCP-1 gene promoter region influences clinical outcomes among nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The study population consisted of 411 NPC patients without metastasis at diagnosis. All patients were treated at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from March 1994 to November 2004. The MCP-1 SNP-2518 genotype of each patient was determined by TaqMan genotyping kit. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients according to genotype. MCP-1 expression in tumor biopsies was examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among 411 NPC patients, carriers of AA and AG genotypes were prone to distant metastasis than that of GG genotype (hazard ratio, 2.21; P = 0.017, and hazard ratio, 2.23; P = 0.005, for AA and AG genotype, respectively) after initial radiotherapy. No genotype-specific significant difference was found in DSS, PFS, and LRFS. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry revealed that MCP-1 expression level was higher in NPC tumor cells from GG carriers compared with those from AA and AG carriers. CONCLUSIONS: MCP-1 SNP-2518 may be a valuable genetic marker for assessing the risk of developing distant metastasis after the radiotherapy in NPC patients. Carriers of A allele may require more aggressive chemotherapy implicating a potential marker for personalized medicine. We speculate that a regulatory SNP may be associated with the distant metastasis of NPC. Validation studies are warranted.

126	Can an IL13 -1112 C/T (rs1800925) polymorphism predict responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and survival of Chinese Han patients with locally advanced rectal cancer	English	2016	27167201	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27167201	Journal Article	Chinese Han	58	41	17	58.5	\N	[15.0,75.0)	All patients were treated with megavoltage radiotherapy (6-8 MV) to the primary tumor and mesorectal, presacral, and internal iliac lymph nodes up to the level of the bottom of the fifth lumbar vertebra by a linear accelerator. Forty-two were treated using 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) with one poster and two lateral fields, and received 46 Gy with a daily fraction of 2.0 Gy given 5 days per week. Six were treated using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and received a concurrent boost to the tumor of 4 Gy with whole pelvic radiotherapy to a dose of 46 Gy. Ten were treated using 2-dimensional conventional radiotherapy with 3 fields of one poster and two lateral fields, and also received a total dose of 46 Gy with a daily fraction of 2.0 Gy given 5 days per week. All patients except 1 received concurrent chemotherapy during radiotherapy, 49 of them received 2 cycles of Xelox (capecitabine 1000 mg/㎡ given twice daily on days1-14 plus a 2-hour intravenous infusion of oxaliplatin 100 mg/㎡ on d1, every 3 weeks), 1 received 1 cycle of Xelox, 6 received 2 cycles of mFOLFOX6 (leucovorin plus oxaliplatin plus 5-FU). Surgery was performed at a median interval of 47 days after chemoradiotherapy (range, 29-76 days), observing principles of TME.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	We sought to determine whether a polymorphism in the Interleukin 13 gene (IL13), 1112 C/T (rs1800925) predicts responsiveness to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT) and prognosis in Chinese Han patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Pre-treatment biopsies of primary rectal lesion and surgical specimens were collected from 58 patients with LARC, who were treated with neoCRT and surgery. Tumor DNA was extracted from these biopsies and sequenced to analyze the rs1800925 polymorphism. The tumor response to neoCRT was categorized using a tumor regression grade (TRG, 0-2 were poor responders; 3-4 were good responders). Analyses of progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were carried out using the Kaplan-Meier method. Of the forty-six patients for whom tumor DNA was successfully sequenced, 23 were good responders to neoCRT (11 patients with a pathological complete response, i.e. pCR) and the other 23 were poor responders. Good and poor responders were equally likely to have a C/C genotype at rs1800925 (73.9%) as a T/T or C/T genotype (26.1%). There were no differences between the C/C and T/T+C/T genotypes with respect to the ypT0-2 ratio (38.2% vs. 41.7%, P = 1.0) , ypN0 nodal status (67.6% vs. 50.0%, P= 0.314), 6-year PFS (67.6% vs. 50%, P=0.274), or 6-year OS (76.5% vs. 66.7%, P=0.441). Thus, the IL13-1112 C/T (rs1800925) polymorphism does not predict responsiveness to neoCRT or prognosis of Chinese Han patients with LARC.	Oncotarget	Stage II: 13 patients, Stage III: 45 patients.
127	A common variant in MTHFR influences response to chemoradiotherapy and recurrence of rectal cancer	English	2015	26693073	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26693073	Journal Article	\N	108	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	The neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) protocol consisted of the traditional long course of 5040 cGy radiation over a period of five weeks with infusion of 5-FU. For all subjects, surgery followed at a minimum of six weeks after the conclusion of CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	An important determinant of the pathogenesis and prognosis of various diseases is inherited genetic variation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variations at a single base position, have been identified in both protein-coding and noncoding DNA sequences, but the vast majority of millions of those variants are far from being functionally understood. Here we show that a common variant in the gene MTHFR [rs1801133 (C>T)] not only influences response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer, but it also influences recurrence of the disease itself. More specifically, patients with the homozygous ancestral (wild type) genotype (C/C) were 2.91 times more likely (291% increased benefit) to respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy {95% CI: [1.23, 6.89]; P=0.0150} and 3.25 times more likely (325% increased benefit) not to experience recurrence of the disease {95% CI: [1.37, 7.72]; P=0.0079} than patients with either the heterozygous (C/T) or the homozygous mutation (T/T) genotype. These results identify MTHFR as an important genetic marker and open up new, pharmacogenomic strategies in the treatment and management of rectal cancer.	American Journal of Cancer Research	\N

Among these patients, 970 patients received inducing chemotherapy, 1039 patients received concurrent chemotherapy, and 94 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy with high metastatic potential and loco-regional recurrence. The overall survival of NPC has been limited from further improvement partly due to the lack of effective biomarker for accurate prognosis prediction and precise treatments. Here, in light of the implication of CELF gene family in cancer prognosis, we selected 112 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in six members of the family and tested their associations with the clinical outcomes in a discovery cohort of 717 NPC patients. Survival analyses under multivariate cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve revealed five promising SNPs, which were further validated in another independent sample of 1,520 cases. Combined analysis revealed that SNP rs3740194 in CELF2 was significantly associated with the decreased risk of death with a Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.58-0.82, codominant model). Moreover, rs3740194 also showed a significant association with superior metastasis-free survival (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.57-0.83, codominant model). Taken together, our findings suggested that genetic variant of rs3740194 in CELF2 gene might be a valuable predictor for NPC prognosis, and potentially useful in the personalized treatment of NPC.

129	The MGMT promoter SNP rs16906252 is a risk factor for MGMT methylation in glioblastoma and is predictive of response to temozolomide	English	2015	25910840	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910840	Journal Article	Australian; American	322	\N	\N	\N	\N	[22.3,85.0)	All patients received concurrent radiotherapy plus temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Promoter methylation of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is an important predictive biomarker in glioblastoma. The T variant of the MGMT promoter-enhancer single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs16906252) has been associated with the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in other cancers. We examined the association of the T allele of rs16906252 with glioblastoma development, tumor MGMT methylation, MGMT protein expression, and survival outcomes. METHODS: Two independent temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cohorts-one Australian (Australian Genomics and Clinical Outcomes of Glioma, n = 163) and the other American (University of California Los Angeles/Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles, n = 159)-were studied. Allelic bisulphite sequencing was used to determine if methylation was specific to the T allele. Additionally, we compared the incidence of the T allele between glioblastoma cases and matched controls to assess whether it was a risk factor for developing MGMT methylated glioblastoma. RESULTS: Carriage of the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP was associated with both MGMT methylation and low MGMT protein expression and predicted significantly longer survival in temozolomide-treated patients with both MGMT methylated and nonmethylated glioblastoma. Methylation was linked to the T allele, inferring that the T variant plays a key role in the acquisition of MGMT methylation. Carriage of the T allele was associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing glioblastoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; P = .013), increasing further when glioblastoma was classified by the presence of MGMT methylation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.86; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The T allele of the rs16906252 SNP is a key determinant in the acquisition of MGMT methylation in glioblastoma. Temozolomide-treated patients with the rs16906252 T genotype have better survival, irrespective of tumor methylation status.	Neuro-Oncology	\N

Seventy-seven patients were treated with 1.8 Gy per fraction five times per week and six patients received 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy, amounting to a total dose of 50.4 or 50 Gy, respectively. 67% of patients received a boost of 9 or 10 Gy administered in five fractions of 1.8 or 2 Gy, respectively. 75 patients received hormonotherapy with tamoxifen. At 50 Gy, prior to boost application, erythema of the breast, excluding folds and scars, was evaluated using the RTOG score.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To examine the association of polymorphisms in ATM (codon 158), GSTP1 (codon 105), SOD2 (codon 16), TGFB1 (position -509), XPD (codon 751), and XRCC1 (codon 399) with the risk of severe erythema after breast conserving radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis of 83 breast cancer patients treated with breast conserving radiotherapy. A total dose of 50.4 Gy was administered, applying 1.8 Gy/fraction within 42 days. Erythema was evaluated according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) score. DNA was extracted from blood samples and polymorphisms were determined using either the Polymerase Chain Reaction based Restriction-Fragment-Length-Polymorphism (PCR-RFL) technique or Matrix-Assisted-Laser-Desorption/Ionization -Time-Of-Flight-Mass-Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Relative excess heterozygosity (REH) was investigated to check compatibility of genotype frequencies with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). In addition, p-values from the standard exact HWE lack of fit test were calculated using 100,000 permutations. HWE analyses were performed using R. RESULTS: Fifty-six percent (46/83) of all patients developed erythema of grade 2 or 3, with this risk being higher for patients with large breast volume (odds ratio, OR = 2.55, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.03-6.31, p = 0.041). No significant association between SNPs and risk of erythema was found when all patients were considered. However, in patients with small breast volume the TGFB1 SNP was associated with erythema (p = 0.028), whereas the SNP in XPD showed an association in patients with large breast volume (p = 0.046). A risk score based on all risk alleles was neither significant in all patients nor in patients with small or large breast volume. Risk alleles of most SNPs were different compared to a previously identified risk profile for fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic risk profile for erythema appears to be different for patients with small and larger breast volume. This risk profile seems to be specific for erythema as compared to a risk profile for fibrosis.	Radiation Oncology	Stage I-II: 83 patients.
130	Factors modifying the risk for developing acute skin toxicity after whole-breast intensity modulated radiotherapy	English	2014	25252713	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25252713	Journal Article	\N	377	\N	\N	\N	\N	[30.0,82.0)	At GUH, patients were treated in prone or supine position using a multi-beam IMRT technique in supine position and a tangential 2-beam field-in-field IMRT technique in prone position as described previously. The whole breast was treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy (40.05 Gy in 15 fractions) with 6-MV photons of an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator (Crawley, United Kingdom). An additional photon boost of 10 Gy in 4 fractions to the tumour bed was given to 75% of the patients. For the prone patient setup, a unilateral breast holder (Van De Velde, Schellebelle, Belgium) and a prone breast board (Orfit Industries) were used. Twenty-two patients were treated in prone position with voluntary moderate deep inspiration breath hold. At CMSE Namur, a sliding window tangential field-IMRT technique was used associated with moderate deep inspiration breath hold whenever the primary beam intersected the heart as previously described by Remouchamps et al. Patients with self-reported bra cup size ≥ D received normofractionated radiotherapy (50.00 Gy in 25 fractions), women with bra cup size < D received hypofractionation or normofractionation according to the preference of the radiation oncologist (n = 28). More than 90% received an additional boost of 10 Gy in 4 fractions with electron beams. Nodal irradiation was performed by a complex multi-beam IMRT or arc technique at GUH, at CMSE Namur, a one point setup with 4 beams with dynamic intensity modulation in the beams was used. Adjuvant hormone therapy, consisting of tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, was administered in most patients concomitantly with IMRT. The others received hormone therapy sequentially after IMRT. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, combination of antracyclines and taxanes, completed chemotherapy before IMRT, while trastuzumab was allowed concomitantly with IMRT.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: After breast-conserving radiation therapy most patients experience acute skin toxicity to some degree. This may impair patients' quality of life, cause pain and discomfort. In this study, we investigated treatment and patient-related factors, including genetic polymorphisms, that can modify the risk for severe radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. METHODS: We studied 377 patients treated at Ghent University Hospital and at ST.-Elisabeth Clinic and Maternity in Namur, with adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) after breast-conserving surgery for breast cancer. Women were treated in a prone or supine position with normofractionated (25 × 2 Gy) or hypofractionated (15 × 2.67 Gy) IMRT alone or in combination with other adjuvant therapies. Patient- and treatment-related factors and genetic markers in regulatory regions of radioresponsive genes and in LIG3, MLH1 and XRCC3 genes were considered as variables. Acute dermatitis was scored using the CTCAEv3.0 scoring system. Desquamation was scored separately on a 3-point scale (0-none, 1-dry, 2-moist). RESULTS: Two-hundred and twenty patients (58%) developed G2+ dermatitis whereas moist desquamation occurred in 56 patients (15%). Normofractionation (both p < 0.001), high body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.003 and p < 0.001), bra cup size ≥ D (p = 0.001 and p = 0.043) and concurrent hormone therapy (p = 0.001 and p = 0.037) were significantly associated with occurrence of acute dermatitis and moist desquamation, respectively. Additional factors associated with an increased risk of acute dermatitis were the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734 (p=0.008), smoking during RT (p = 0.010) and supine IMRT (p = 0.004). Patients receiving trastuzumab showed decreased risk of acute dermatitis (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The normofractionation schedule, supine IMRT, concomitant hormone treatment and patient related factors (high BMI, large breast, smoking during treatment and the genetic variation in MLH1 rs1800734) were associated with increased acute skin toxicity in patients receiving radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery. Trastuzumab seemed to be protective.	BMC Cancer	\N

They were given a conventional (50 Gy, 2 Gy in 5 fractions) or hypofractioned (44 Gy, 2.75 Gy in 5 fractions) breast radiation treatment followed by a 10–16 Gy electron boost. The average biologically effective radiation dose (BED) was 56.4 ± 6.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Clinical radiosensitivity varies considerably among patients, and radiation-induced side effects developing in normal tissue can be therapy limiting. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been shown to correlate with hypersensitivity to radiotherapy. We conducted a prospective study of 87 female patients with breast cancer who received radiotherapy after breast surgery. We evaluated the association between acute skin reaction following radiotherapy and 11 genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes: XRCC1 (Arg399Gln and Arg194Trp), XRCC3 (Thr241Met), XPD (Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln), MSH2 (gIVS12-6T>C), MLH1 (Ile219Val), MSH3 (Ala1045Thr), MGMT (Leu84Phe), and in damage-detoxification GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes (allele deletion). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Individual genetic polymorphisms were determined by polymerase chain reaction and single nucleotide primer extension for single nucleotide polymorphisms or by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for deletion polymorphisms. The development of severe acute skin reaction (moist desquamation or interruption of radiotherapy due to toxicity) associated with genetic polymorphisms was modeled using Cox proportional hazards, accounting for cumulative biologically effective radiation dose. RESULTS: Radiosensitivity developed in eight patients and was increased in carriers of variants XRCC3-241Met allele (hazard ratio [HR] unquantifiably high), MSH2 gIVS12-6nt-C allele (HR=53.36; 95% confidence intervals [95% CI], 3.56-798.98), and MSH3-1045Ala allele (HR unquantifiably high). Carriers of XRCC1-Arg194Trp variant allele in combination with XRCC1-Arg399Gln wild-type allele had a significant risk of radiosensitivity (HR=38.26; 95% CI, 1.19-1232.52). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report to find an association between MSH2 and MSH3 genetic variants and the development of radiosensitivity in breast cancer patients. Our findings suggest the hypothesis that mismatch repair mechanisms may be involved in cellular response to radiotherapy. Genetic polymorphisms may be promising candidates for predicting acute radiosensitivity, but further studies are necessary to confirm our findings.

The patients also underwent two-to-three cycles of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and were administered cisplatin every 3 weeks. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was adopted in conjunction with CCRT in some patients. The NACT regimen comprised the administration of cisplatin with docetaxel every 3 weeks for two cycles. The chemotherapy was discontinued when the patient showed leukocyte counts lower than 3,000/mm³ , or platelet count lower than 75,000/mm³ . The chemotherapy was continued when the leukocyte and platelet counts reverted to the normal values.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor that plays a critical role in the development, metastasis, and recurrence of tumors. This study aims to determine the correlation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the VEGF gene with the prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The VEGF -460T/C gene polymorphisms in the genomic DNA of the blood samples of 338 patients with NPC were investigated through polymerase chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing. Results showed a significant association between the -460C-allele carriers and the aggressive forms of NPC as defined by stages N2-3 (odds ratio =1.820, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.118-2.962, P=0.015). Furthermore, the VEGF -460T/C polymorphism was significantly associated with 3-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) (T/C + C/C vs T/T: 3-year OS 78.8% vs 95.1%, P=0.003; 3-year DMFS 80.2% vs 90.6%, P=0.036; 3-year PFS 73.9% vs 86.7%, P=0.042) but was not associated with the local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) of the patients. The multivariate analysis indicated that the VEGF -460C-allele carrier was an independent significant prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR] 4.096, 95% CI: 1.333-12.591, P=0.014). N classification was an independent significant prognostic factor for DMFS in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC (HR 3.674, 95% CI: 1.144-11.792, P=0.029). However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was not superior to CCRT alone in terms of the 3-year OS, LRFS, DMFS, and PFS of patients with VEGF -460T/C polymorphism. In conclusion, the VEGF -460T/C gene polymorphism may negatively affect the clinical outcomes of patients with NPC and may be considered a potential prognostic factor for this disease.

133	DNA repair gene ERCC1 C118T polymorphism predicts sensitivity of recurrent esophageal cancer to radiochemotherapy in a Chinese population	English	2015	26557912	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26557912	Journal Article	Chinese	118	96	22	\N	\N	[18.0,80.0)	Out of 118 patients ,49 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy immediately after surgery, taxanes plus platinum in 40 cases and fluoropyrimidine plus platinum in nine cases, every three weeks for up to six cycles. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy was delivered to 13 patients that were treated with paclitaxel plus platinum (n = 7) or fluoropyrimidineplusplatinum(n=6)forthreeweeksforup to three cycles.Forty-four patients were treated with concurrent radiochemotherapy of fluoropyrimidine plus platinum (n = 21) or taxanes plus platinum (n = 17) or irinotecan plus platinum (n = 6). Sixty patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after radiotherapy with a regimen comprising taxanes plus platinum for three weeks for up to three cycles; only one patient received radiation therapy. All patients received radiotherapy through 8MV-X linear accelerator three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy according to target tumor lesions. The median radiation dose was 60 Gy (range: 45–66 Gy), dosed at a daily fraction of 1.8 to 2 Gy, five times per week.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: DNA repair gene polymorphisms could alter DNA repair capacity and therefore associate with tumor sensitivity to radiochemotherapy. This study assessed excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) C118T and X-ray cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) G399A single-nucleotide polymorphisms in esophageal patients for an association with sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy. METHODS: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients (n = 118) who relapsed after surgery were enrolled for assessment of ERCC1 C118T and XRCC1 G399A polymorphisms by direct DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The response rate of treatments was 48.30%: 14 complete response (CR, 11.86%), 43 partial response (PR, 36.44%), 49 stable disease (SD, 41.53%), and 12 progressive disease (PD, 10.17%). ERCC1 C118T was significantly associated with treatment response (C/T vs. C/C + T/T, odds ratio [OR] = 6.035, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.114-17.226, P = 0.001) after adjusting for other clinicopathological factors. Patients carrying the C/T genotype had significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with C/C and T/T (median OS 43.00 vs. 27.00, P = 0.027). Multivariate Cox regression showed that a response was only an independent prognostic factor for OS (CR + PR vs. SD+PD, HR = 0.471 95% CI 0.269-0.826, P = 0.009). Grade III and IV adverse events occurred in 12 of 118 patients (10.17%). Only concurrent radiochemotherapy significantly increased these adverse events (OR = 26.529, 95% CI 2.312-304.389, P = 0.008). CONCLUSION: ERCC1 C118T could be a predictive factor for the response to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but not a prognostic factor for OS in esophageal cancer patients after surgery.

Radiotherapy	5	Normal tissue reactions to radiation therapy vary in severity among patients and cannot be accurately predicted, limiting treatment doses. The existence of heritable radiosensitivity syndromes suggests that normal tissue reaction severity is determined, at least in part, by genetic factors and these may be revealed by differences in gene expression. To test this hypothesis, peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 22 breast cancer patients with either minimal (11) or very severe acute skin reactions (11) have been used to analyse gene expression. Basal and post-irradiation expression of four radiation-responsive genes (CDKN1A, GADD45A, CCNB1, and BBC3) was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in T-cell cultures established from the two patient groups before radiotherapy. Relative expression levels of BBC3, CCNB1, and GADD45A 2 h following 2 Gy X-rays did not discriminate between groups. However, post-irradiation expression response was significantly reduced for CDKN1A (P<0.002) in severe reactors compared to normal. Prediction of reaction severity of approximately 91% of individuals sampled was achieved using this end point. Analysis of TP53 Arg72Pro and CDKN1A Ser31Arg single nucleotide polymorphisms did not show any significant association with reaction sensitivity. Although these results require confirmation and extension, this study demonstrates the possibility of predicting the severity of acute skin radiation toxicity in simple tests.

The median total dose for the chest wall was 50 Gy, with additional boost doses totaling 10 Gy for patients with a conserved breast.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Heterogeneity in radiation therapy (RT)-induced normal tissue toxicity is observed in 10% of cancer patients, limiting the therapeutic outcomes. In addition to treatment-related factors, normal tissue adverse reactions also manifest from genetic alterations in distinct pathways majorly involving DNA damage-repair genes, inflammatory cytokine genes, cell cycle regulation, and antioxidant response. Therefore, the common sequence variants in these radioresponsive genes might modify the severity of normal tissue toxicity, and the identification of the same could have clinical relevance as a predictive biomarker. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The present study was conducted in a cohort of patients with breast cancer to evaluate the possible associations between genetic variants in radioresponsive genes described previously and the risk of developing RT-induced acute skin adverse reactions. We tested 22 genetic variants reported in 18 genes (ie, NFE2L2, OGG1, NEIL3, RAD17, PTTG1, REV3L, ALAD, CD44, RAD9A, TGFβR3, MAD2L2, MAP3K7, MAT1A, RPS6KB2, ZNF830, SH3GL1, BAX, and XRCC1) using TaqMan assay-based real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of RT, the severity of skin damage was scored, and the subjects were dichotomized as nonoverresponders (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade <2) and overresponders (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade ≥2) for analysis. RESULTS: Of the 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms studied, the rs8193 polymorphism lying in the micro-RNA binding site of 3'-UTR of CD44 was significantly (P=.0270) associated with RT-induced adverse skin reactions. Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis showed significant (P=.0107) gene-gene interactions between MAT1A and CD44. Furthermore, an increase in the total number of risk alleles was associated with increasing occurrence of overresponses (P=.0302). CONCLUSIONS: The genetic polymorphisms in radioresponsive genes act as genetic modifiers of acute normal tissue toxicity outcomes after RT by acting individually (rs8193), by gene-gene interactions (MAT1A and CD44), and/or by the additive effects of risk alleles.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and its interaction with postoperative chemoradiotherapy in the prognosis of oral cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study involving 304 oral cancer patients with surgical resection was conducted in Fujian, China. Demographic and clinical data (adjuvant therapy types, histologic types, clinical stage, etc.) were extracted from medical records, and follow-up data were obtained by telephone interviews. We collected 5 to 8 mL of venous blood from all patients for DNA extraction, and rs174549 genotypes were determined by TaqMan assays (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). A Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curve were used to assess the association between FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and progression-free survival (PFS), as well as overall survival, in oral cancer. RESULTS: Carrying the AA genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PFS: The hazard ratio was 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.93) for the codominant model and 0.54 (95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.94) for the recessive model. Moreover, better PFS was particularly obvious in patients who had received chemoradiotherapy. A positive multiplicative interaction between FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and chemoradiotherapy was observed for PFS (P = .036). No significant association was found between FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism and overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests, for the first time, that FADS1 rs174549 polymorphism is a potentially independent and favorable factor in predicting oral cancer PFS especially for patients who undergo chemoradiotherapy, and it may serve as a potential target for individualized treatment in the future.

136	Overall and Relapse-Free Survival in Oropharyngeal and Hypopharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Are Associated with Genotypes ofT393C Polymorphism of the GNAS1 Gene	English	2008	18347176	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18347176	Journal Article	Caucasian	202	162	40	\N	58.5	\N	All patients received radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: In previous studies, we have shown that the T allele of a specific single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Galphas gene (T393C) correlates with increased Galphas expression and hence apoptosis. The T allele was associated with a favorable outcome in a variety of human cancers, e.g., carcinoma of the urinary bladder, kidney, and colorectum. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The prognostic value of the T393C SNP was evaluated in an unselected series of patients treated with curative intent for oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, including all tumor stages with different therapeutic regimens. Genotype analysis was done using DNA from paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 202 patients (162 men, 40 women) with a median follow-up of 38 months (1-133 months). The various genotypes were correlated with relapse-free and overall survival. RESULTS: GNAS1 393C homozygous patients displayed a higher risk for disease progression than T393 homozygous patients (hazard ratio CC versus TT, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.2; P = 0.019). The same genotype effect was observed for overall survival with CC genotypes at higher risk for death compared with TT genotypes (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.9; P = 0.015). Multivariate analysis showed that, besides American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor localization, and gender, the T393C polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor for disease progression and death. CONCLUSION: The T393C SNP could be considered as a genetic marker to predict the clinical course of patients suffering from oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer.

137	A phase II study of preoperative chemoradiation with tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin for locally advanced rectal cancer with pharmacogenetic analysis	English	2017	28347333	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28347333	Journal Article	\N	91	68	23	59	\N	[33.0,75.0)	Chemoradiation (CRT) was started within 14 days after screening and obtaining informed consent. Enteric-coated tegafur-uracil (UFT-E) was given orally as 400 mg/㎡ of tegafur divided into three daily doses without drug holidays during RT. Since each package of UFT-E contains 500 mg of granules that corresponded to 100 mg of tegafur, the recommended dosing schedule according to body surface area (BSA) was as follows: BSA ≤ 1.37 ㎡ : 2, 2, and 1 packages an hour after break- fast, lunch and dinner, respectively; BSA 1.38 ㎡ – 1.62 ㎡ : 2, 2, and 2 packages; BSA 1.63 ㎡ – 1.87 ㎡ : 3, 2, and 2 packages; and BSA ≥ 1.88 ㎡ : 3, 3, and 2 packages. Each dose of UFT-E was administered with 2 15-mg tab- lets of leucovorin (LV), corresponding to a total daily dose of 90 mg. Preoperative radiation (RT) was delivered concurrently to the whole pelvis at a dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by 5.4 Gy in a three-fraction boost to the primary tumor. The details of RT simulation, beam weights, and the RT field have been described previously. Surgery was planned within 6 ± 2 weeks of the completion of CRT. TME was the first-choice surgical treatment, with the final decision regarding the choice of surgical procedure (abdominoperineal or anterior resection) made by the surgeon with the approval of a multidisciplinary team. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered at discretion of the treating medical oncologist (SYK and JYB). One of the following regimens was administered for 4 months: 4 cycles of Mayo regimen 5-FU (5-fluorouracil)/LV (5-FU 400 mg/㎡ and LV 20 mg/㎡ on days 1–5, every 4 weeks), 3 or 4 cycles of UFT-E/LV (UFT-E 300 mg/㎡ and LV 90 mg/day on day 1–28, every 5 weeks), or 8 cycles of FOLFOX-6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/㎡ , LV 200 mg/㎡ , 5-FU bolus 400 mg/㎡ and 5-FU continuous infusion 2400 mg/㎡ for 46 h every 2 weeks).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a high dose of oral tegafur-uracil (400 mg/m2) plus leucovorin with preoperative chemoradiation of locally advanced rectal cancer and to explore the impact of polymorphisms of cytochrome P 2A6 (CYP2A6), uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS), and ATP-binding cassette B1 (ABCB1) on clinical outcome. METHODS: Patients with cT3 or cT4 rectal cancer were enrolled and were given tegafur-uracil 400 mg/m2/day and leucovorin 90 mg/m2/day for 7 days a week during preoperative chemoradiation (50.4 Gy/28 fractions) in this phase II trial. Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response rate, and the secondary endpoint was to explore the association between clinical outcomes and genetic polymorphisms CYP2A6 (*4, *7, *9 and *10), UMPS G638C, and three ABCB1 genotypes (C1236T, C3435T, and G2677T). RESULTS: Ninety-one patients were given study treatment, and 90 underwent surgery. Pathologic complete response was noted in 10 patients (11.1%). There was no grade 4 or 5 toxicity; 20 (22.0%) experienced grade 3 toxicities, including diarrhea (10, 11.0%), abdominal pain (2, 2.2%), and anemia (2, 2.2%). Relapse-free survival and overall survival at 5 years were 88.6% and 94.2%, respectively. Patients with the UMPS 638 CC genotype experienced significantly more frequent grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (p for trend = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemoradiation with tegafur-uracil 400 mg/m2/day with leucovorin was feasible, but did not meet the expected pathologic complete response rate. The UMPS 638 CC genotype might be a candidate biomarker predicting toxicity in patients receiving tegafur-uracil/leucovorin-based preoperative chemoradiation for locally advanced rectal cancer.

138	MicroRNA-Related Polymorphisms in PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway Genes Are Predictive of Limited-Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment Outcomes	English	2017	28280736	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28280736	Journal Article	\N	146	104	42	56.7999999999999972	\N	[29.0,80.0)	All patients treated with curative-intent platin-based chemotherapy combined with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Chemotherapy was delivered based on an EP (etoposide + cisplatin) or EC (etoposide + carboplatin) regimen, usually for 2–4 cycles; concurrent treatment was given to 54.8% patients with no difference in overall survival compared to those receiving sequential treatment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays an important role in cancer progression and treatment, including that of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a disease with traditionally poor prognosis. Given the regulatory role of microRNA (miRNA) in gene expression, we examined the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at miRNA-binding sites of genes in the mTOR pathway with the prognosis of patients with limited-disease SCLC. A retrospective study was conducted of 146 patients with limited-disease SCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy. Nine SNPs of six mTOR pathway genes were genotyped using blood samples. Cox proportional hazard regression modeling and recursive partitioning analysis were performed to identify SNPs significantly associated with overall survival. Three SNPs, MTOR: rs2536 (T>C), PIK3R1: rs3756668 (A>G), and PIK3R1: rs12755 (A>C), were associated with longer overall survival. Recursive partitioning analysis based on unfavorable genotype combinations of the rs2536 and rs3756668 SNPs classified patients into three risk subgroups and was internally validated with 1000 bootstrap samples. These findings suggest that miRNA-related polymorphisms in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway may be valuable biomarkers to complement clinicopathological variables in predicting prognosis of limited-disease SCLC and to facilitate selection of patients likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy.

139	Polymorphisms of ESR1, UGT1A1, HCN1, MAP3K1 and CYP2B6 are associated with the prognosisof hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer	English	2017	28178648	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28178648	Journal Article	\N	414	\N	\N	48	\N	[23.0,81.0)	All enrolled patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to all patients after breast conservation surgery.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by genome-wide association study (GWAS) (MAP3K1, FGFR2, TNRC9, HCN1, and 5p12), and SNPs involved in the metabolism of estrogen (CYP19, COMT, ESR1, and UGT1A1), tamoxifen (CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A5, and CYP2D6), and chemotherapeutic agents (ABCB1, ALDH3A1, and CYP2B6) are associated with the prognoses of 414 hormone receptor (HR)-positive early breast cancers with negative or 1 to 3 nodal metastases. At a median follow-up period of 10.6 years, 363 patients were alive, and 51 (12.3%) had died. Multiple-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals for distant disease-free survival (DDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in association with the genotypes of 34 SNPs from the above-mentioned 16 genes were evaluated, using the stepwise selection Cox model. We found that the SNP, ESR1-codon325 rs1801132 (G/G+G/C), was associated with a longer DDFS, whereas UGT1A1 rs4148323 (A/A+A/G), and HCN1 rs981782 (A/A+A/C) were significantly associated with poorer DDFS. MAP3K1 rs889312 (C/C) and CYP2B6 rs3211371 (T/C) were significantly associated with poor DFS, DDFS and OS. Among premenopausal women, MAP3K1 rs889312 (C/C), CYP2B6 rs3211371 (T/C), CYP2B6 rs4802101 (T/T), ABCB1 rs2032582 (C/C), and ALDH3A1 rs2231142 (G/G) were significantly associated with poor DDFS, DFS, or OS. Our results provide additional evidence that genetic polymorphisms observed in SNPs are associated with the prognoses of patients with HR-positive breast cancers; this may indicate different treatment strategies for these patients.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	CHEK1 gene is known to play an important role in tumor progression by cell cycle control. However, the association between CHEK1 and the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is unclear. In this study, we explored the association between genetic variants in CHEK1 gene and prognosis of ESCC patients treated with radical resection. A total of 131 thoracic ESCC patients who underwent radical resection were included in this retrospective study and genotyped using the MassArray method. According to the univariate Cox hazard analysis, the GT/TT genotype of CHEK1 rs555752 was shown to be strongly related to a decreased overall survival (OS) (HR=2.560, 95% CI: 1.415-4.631, P=0.002) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR=2.160, 95% CI: 1.258-3.710, P=0.005). Furthermore, according to the multivariate Cox hazard analysis and multiple testing, patients with the GT/TT genotype of CHEK1 rs555752 had a notably decreased OS (HR=2.735, 95% CI: 1.468-5.096, P=0.002, Pc=0.006) and DFS (HR=2.282, 95% CI: 1.292-4.023, P=0.004, Pc=0.012). In conclusion, genetic variants of the CHEK1 gene are significantly related to OS and DFS of ESCC patients, and may therefore be predictors of the prognosis of thoracic ESCC after surgery.

141	Association of XRCC1 and XRCC3 gene haplotypes with the development of radiation-inducedfibrosis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2014	24940494	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24940494	Journal Article	Chinese	120	85	25	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy was administered at 2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week for 6‑7 weeks. The patients who received conventional radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy generally received a total dose of 66‑68 Gy and 70‑76 Gy to the tumour, respectively.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Radiation-induced fibrosis is one of the late complications of radiotherapy (RT) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 1 and 3 (XRCC1 and XRCC3, respectively) gene haplotypes and radiation-induced fibrosis in NPC patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 120 NPC patients previously treated with RT. In total, 12 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from the XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes and were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or unlabeled probe melting analysis. Single-marker and haplotype analyses were performed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The functional variant rs861539 of XRCC3 may be associated with radiation-induced fibrosis [asymptotic P-value (Pasym)<0.05]. No significant association was observed between radiation-induced fibrosis and any of the tag SNPs of XRCC1 and XRCC3 in either single-marker or haplotype analysis after 10,000 permutations [empirical P-value (Pemp)>0.05]. Our preliminary results indicated that the rs861539 variant of XRCC3 may be associated with an increased risk of radiation-induced fibrosis; however, a large-scale study is required to confirm this result.

Patients with gross disease were treated using Linac 6-MV X-ray linear accelerator (Elekta Precise digital, Stockholm, Sweden) with the total tumor dose of 70 Gy (2 Gy per day for 5 days week). Patients after surgical resection having positive margins were given a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions. Patients with no positive margins were given 60 Gy in 30 fractions. Dose to parotid gland, submandibular salivary glands, constrictor muscles and other structures were not restricted in view of 3-Dimensional treatment planning in all the patients. Cisplatin chemotherapy (100 mg/㎡ for once in 3 weeks) was given to majority of the patients when serum creatinine was normal. Elderly patients received a weekly dose of 40 mg/㎡ for 6 weeks and patients having borderline elevation of serum creatinine received carboplatin (area under curve (AUC) @ 1.5) on a weekly basis for 6 weeks. A total of 148 patients received concurrent chemoradiotherapy and the remaining patients were received radiotherapy alone.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Cellular and molecular approaches are being explored to find a biomarker which can predict the development of radiation induced acute toxicity prior to radiation therapy. SNPs in radiation responsive genes may be considered as an approach to develop tools for finding the inherited basis of clinical radiosensitivity. The current study attempts to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms/deletions in DNA damage response, DNA repair, profibrotic cytokine as well as antioxidant response genes and its predictive potential with the normal tissue adverse reactions from 183 head and neck cancer patients undergoing platinum based chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. We analysed 22 polymorphisms in 17 genes having functional relevance to radiation response. Radiation therapy induced oral mucositis and skin erythema was considered as end point for clinical radiosensitivity. Direct correlation of heterozygous and mutant alleles with acute reactions as well as haplotype correlation revealed NBN variants to be of predictive significance in analysing oral mucositis prior to radiotherapy. In addition, genetic linkage disequilibrium existed in XRCC1 polymorphisms for >grade 2 oral mucositis and skin reaction indicating the complex inheritance pattern. The current study indicates an association for polymorphism in NBN with normal tissue radiosensitivity and further warrants the replication of such studies in a large set of samples.

Radiotherapy was delivered 1–3 months after surgery in case of no adjuvant systemic treatment or hormone therapy and 4–6 months after surgery in case of adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients were given whole breast radiotherapy with conventional fraction (50–50.4 Gy; 1.8–2 Gy/fraction), with photons (6–18 MV) or 60 Co c-rays (1.25 MV). Treatment was followed by electron (9– 10.5 MeV) in 264/286 cases (92.3%) or orthovoltage (200 kV X- rays) boost (9–16 Gy; 1.5–3 Gy/fraction) in 22/286 cases (7.7%) according to tumor characteristics.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of functional polymorphisms in genes related to DNA repair mechanisms (XRCC1, TP53, MSH2, MSH3, XPD), oxidative stress response (GSTP1, GSTA1, eNOS, SOD2) and fibroblast proliferation (TGFβ1) on the risk of acute skin toxicity in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Skin toxicity was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria in 286 breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Genotyping was conducted by PCR-RFLP analysis and real-time PCR allelic discrimination assay on genomic DNA extracted from peripheral blood. RESULTS: In the multivariate analysis, nominally significant associations, before multiple testing corrections, were found between XRCC1 T-77C (T carriers vs. CC, OR: 2.240, 95% CI: 1.015-4.941, P=0.046), eNOS G894T polymorphisms (TT vs. G carriers, OR: 2.473, 95% CI: 1.220-5.012, P=0.012), breast diameter (OR: 1.138, 95% CI: 1.001-1.293, P=0.048), boost dose-fractionation (3 Gy vs. no boost, OR: 4.902, 95% CI: 1.458-16.483, P=0.010) and ≥ grade 2 acute radiation skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: As our exploratory study suggests that XRCC1 T-77C and eNOS G874T may confer an increased risk of acute skin reactions to radiotherapy in breast cancer patients, further confirmatory studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance.

The mean tumor dose was 62 Gy, (range 54–70 Gy). Irradiation was performed with photon beams from 6-MeV linear accelerators using 3D conformal radiation therapy or IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) with SIB (simultaneous integrated boost). Fifty-six patients out of 101 received both radiotherapy plus chemotherapy. Sequential or concomitant chemotherapy schedules were based on derivatives of platinum, 5-ﬂuorouracile, taxanes and/or cetuximab.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Individual variability in radiosensitivity is large in cancer patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in DNA repair and in protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) could be responsible for such cases of radiosensitivity. We investigated the association between the occurrence of acute reactions in 101 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) after radiotherapy (RT) and five genetic polymorphisms: XRCC1 c.1196A>G, XRCC3 c.722C>T, RAD51 (c.-3429G>C, c.-3392G>T), and GSTP1 c.313A>G. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Genetic polymorphisms were detected by high resolution melting analysis (HRMA). The development of acute reactions (oral mucositis, skin erythema and dysphagia) associated with genetic polymorphisms was modeled using Cox proportional hazards, accounting for biologically effective dose (BED). RESULTS: Development of grade ≥2 mucositis was increased in all patients (chemo-radiotherapy and radiotherapy alone) with XRCC1-399Gln allele (HR=1.72). The likelihood of developing grade ≥2 dysphagia was higher in carriers of RAD51 c.-3429 CC/GC genotypes (HR=4.00). The presence of at least one SNP or the co-presence of both SNPs in XRCC1 p.Gln399Arg /RAD51 c.-3429 G>C status were associated to higher likelihood of occurrence of acute toxicities (HR=2.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed an association between genetic polymorphisms, XRCC1 c.1196A>G and RAD51 c.-3429 G>C, and the development of radiation-induced toxicities in SCCHN patients.

The planning target volume (PTV) dose prescription ranged from 40.05 Gy (55 patients), 45.00 Gy (1 patient), and 50.00 Gy (3 patients). In most cases, the PTV irradiation was followed by a boost phase of 10.00 Gy to the tumoral bed (47 patients). Conventional (200 cGy/day) and accelerated fractionations (250 or 267 cGy/day) were used. Computed tomography images were acquired with a ﬁxed step size of 5 mm. In accordance with the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU 50), the PTV was generated by expanding the clinical target volume, that is, the entire breast for approximately 5 mm from the body contour, of 7 mm in all directions but in the direction of the skin surface, to compensate for set-up uncertainty. In the skin direction, the distance between the body and PTV was left at 5–6 mm so as to not excessively penalize the dose–volume histogram calculations. Ninetyﬁve percent isodose included PTV so this dose was at 5 mm under the skin. All PTVs were contoured by the same radiation oncologist, and a single physicist individually performed all treatment plans. The linear accelerator used was a Varian 2100 (Varian Medical Systems), which has an enhanced dynamic wedge. The treatment planning system (Varian Eclipse version 7.3.10; Varian Medical Systems) used a calculation pencil beam algorithm with the modiﬁed Batho power law as tissue inhomogeneity correction method; the grid calculation dose was 2.5 mm for the dose calculation for all patients. The optimized plan had isocentric photon beams with 6 or 15 MV energy, and the beam separation angle was approximately 174° ± 5° as to align the beam’s internal divergence and to avoid involving the contralateral breast.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Evidence has accumulated in recent years suggestive of a genetic basis for a susceptibility to the development of radiation injury after cancer radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess whether patients with severe radiation-induced sequelae (RIS; i.e., National Cancer Institute/CTCv3.0 grade, > or =3) display both a low capacity of radiation-induced CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis (RILA) in vitro and possess certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in candidate genes associated with the response of cells to radiation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: DNA was isolated from blood samples obtained from patients (n = 399) included in the Swiss prospective study evaluating the predictive effect of in vitro RILA and RIS. SNPs in the ATM, SOD2, XRCC1, XRCC3, TGFB1, and RAD21 genes were screened in patients who experienced severe RIS (group A, n = 16) and control subjects who did not manifest any evidence of RIS (group B, n = 18). RESULTS: Overall, 13 and 21 patients were found to possess a total of <4 and > or =4 SNPs in the candidate genes. The median (range) RILA in group A was 9.4% (5.3-16.5) and 94% (95% confidence interval, 70-100) of the patients (15 of 16) had > or =4 SNPs. In group B, median (range) RILA was 25.7% (20.2-43.2) and 33% (95% confidence interval, 13-59) of patients (6 of 18) had > or =4 SNPs (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that patients with severe RIS possess 4 or more SNPs in candidate genes and low radiation-induced CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro.

At three hospitals, the standard regimen included irradiation of the whole breast, either 50 Gy given in 5 x 2.0 Gy fractions or 50.4 Gy in 5 x 1.8 Gy fractions per week, followed by a photon or electron boost with doses ranging from 5 to 20 Gy. Three patients were treated with brachytherapy (20 or 25 Gy). In the fourth radiation department, patients received 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation in 5 x 2.0 Gy fractions without boost. The biologically effective dose (BED) of radiotherapy relative to an irradiation with a fraction dose of 2.0 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is effective in reducing recurrence; however, telangiectasia and fibrosis can occur as late skin side effects. As radiotherapy acts through producing DNA damage, we investigated whether genetic variation in DNA repair and damage response confers increased susceptibility to develop late normal skin complications. Breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery were examined for late complications of radiotherapy after a median follow-up time of 51 months. Polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair (APEX1, XRCC1, XRCC2, XRCC3, XPD) and damage response (TP53, P21) were determined. Associations between telangiectasia and genotypes were assessed among 409 patients, using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 131 patients presented with telangiectasia and 28 patients with fibrosis. Patients with variant TP53 genotypes either for the Arg72Pro or the PIN3 polymorphism were at increased risk of telangiectasia. The odds ratios (OR) were 1.66 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-2.72) for 72Pro carriers and 1.95 (95% CI: 1.13-3.35) for PIN3 A2 allele carriers compared with non-carriers. The TP53 haplotype containing both variant alleles was associated with almost a two-fold increase in risk (OR 1.97, 95% CI: 1.11-3.52) for telangiectasia. Variants in the TP53 gene may therefore modify the risk of late skin toxicity after radiotherapy.	British Journal of Cancer	Stage I: 277 patients, Stage II: 92 patients.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential association between single nucleotide polymorphisms related response to radiotherapy injury, such as genes related to DNA repair or enzymes involved in anti-oxidative activities. The paper aims to identify marker genes able to predict an increased risk of late toxicity studying our group of patients who underwent a Single Shot 3D-CRT PBI (SSPBI) after BCS (breast conserving surgery). METHODS: A total of 57 breast cancer patients who underwent SSPBI were genotyped for SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in XRCC1, XRCC3, GST and RAD51 by Pyrosequencing technology. Univariate analysis (ORs and 95% CI) was performed to correlate SNPs with the risk of developing ≥ G2 fibrosis or fat necrosis. RESULTS: A higher significant risk of developing ≥ G2 fibrosis or fat necrosis in patients with: polymorphic variant GSTP1 (Ile105Val) (OR = 2.9; 95%CI, 0.88-10.14, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of some SNPs involved in DNA repair or response to oxidative stress seem to be able to predict late toxicity.

147	The late radiotherapy normal tissue injury phenotypes of telangiectasia, fibrosis and atrophy in breast cancer patients have distinct genotype-dependent causes	English	2007	17325707	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17325707	Journal Article	Caucasian; Asian; African	167	\N	\N	\N	56.9200000000000017	[30.0,78.0)	Initial surgery was either a lumpectomy (n = 116) or mastectomy plus axillary dissection (n = 47). Two patients had a lumpectomy but then went on to have a mastectomy, and two had no surgery. Radiotherapy (6 MV X-rays) was given either after mastectomy or lumpectomy using tangential fields, and all patients received similar field sizes. All patients also had a 1.5 cm thick strip of wax 4 cm in width applied to either the lumpectomy or mastectomy scar to reduce ‘skin sparing’ during every second fraction. A total of 119 patients received the then standard departmental protocol of 45 Gy in 20 fractions in 4 weeks given to either the breast or chest wall. Seventy-one of these patients who had been treated by local excision received a boost of 15 Gy in five fractions in 1 week using 8–12 MeV electrons to the site of the lumpectomy. Boost sizes were between 6 x 6 and 8 x 10 cm. Ten patients received 40 Gy in 15 fractions as part of the START B trial (NCRN Trial Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy, 1998). Thirty-three patients were treated with a whole breast dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions either as part of the START trial or following the publication of the European Organisation of Cancer Radiotherapy and Breast Cancer Groups study (EORTC).	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	The relationship between late normal tissue radiation injury phenotypes in 167 breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and: (i) radiotherapy dose (boost); (ii) an early acute radiation reaction and (iii) genetic background was examined. Patients were genotyped at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight candidate genes. An early acute reaction to radiation and/or the inheritance of the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1 -509T) SNP contributed to the risk of fibrosis. In contrast, an additional 15 Gy electron boost and/or the inheritance of X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) (R399Q) SNP contributed to the risk of telangiectasia. Although fibrosis, telangiectasia and atrophy, all contribute to late radiation injury, the data suggest that they have distinct underlying genetic and radiobiological causes. Fibrosis risk is associated with an inflammatory response (an acute reaction and/or TGFbeta1), whereas telangiectasia is associated with vascular endothelial cell damage (boost and/or XRCC1). Atrophy is associated with an acute response, but the genetic predisposing factors that determine the risk of an acute response or atrophy have yet to be identified. A combined analysis of two UK breast cancer patient studies shows that 8% of patients are homozygous (TT) for the TGFbeta1 (C-509T) variant allele and have a 15-fold increased risk of fibrosis following radiotherapy (95% confidence interval: 3.76-60.3; P=0.000003) compared with (CC) homozygotes.

Radiotherapy	5	After irradiation results in cytotoxic effects by DNA damage, base excision repair (BER) pathway is involved in the repair of single-strand breaks and nonhomologous end joining and homologous repair of double-strand breaks caused by radiotherapy. Alterations in the function of BER DNA repair genes may affect DNA repair proficiency and influence the response of patients with cancer to radiotherapy. The association of single nucleotide polymorphisms of BER DNA repair X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 protein (XRCC1) and risk of radiotherapy-induced ≥grade 2 acute skin reaction in patients with breast cancer was examined. It was found that the risk of ≥grade 2 acute skin toxicity after radiotherapy could be increased by 2.86-fold in patients carrying the XRCC1 -77TC and CC genotypes (p = 0.016). However, the other three coding XRCC1 variants did not influence the risk of ≥grade 2 acute skin toxicity for patients with breast cancer after radiotherapy. Our results suggested that the XRCC1 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of radiation-induced acute skin reaction in a Chinese population.

Except for 2 patients, all patients additionally underwent brachytherapy using vaginal ovoids (after hysterectomy), Fletcher-type applications, or perineal implants. All brachytherapy was performed using a pulsed-dose-rate technique with 192 I. The dose rate was between 0.5 and 0.65 Gy/h at 0.5 cm from the applicator surface for ovoids and perineal implants and to point A for the Fletcher-type application.

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To examine the association of polymorphisms in XRCC1 (194Arg/Trp, 280Arg/His, 399Arg/Gln, 632Gln/Gln), XRCC3 (5' UTR 4.541A>G, IVS5-14 17.893A>G, 241Thr/Met), and OGG1 (326Ser/Cys) with the development of late radiotherapy (RT) reactions and to assess the correlation between in vitro chromosomal radiosensitivity and clinical radiosensitivity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-two women with cervical or endometrial cancer treated with RT were included in the study. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0, scale, 22 patients showed late adverse RT reactions. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays were performed to examine polymorphic sites, the G2 assay was used to measure chromosomal radiosensitivity, and patient groups were compared using actuarial methods. RESULTS: The XRCC3 IVS5-14 polymorphic allele was significantly associated with the risk of developing late RT reactions (odds ratio 3.98, p = 0.025), and the XRCC1 codon 194 variant showed a significant protective effect (p = 0.028). Patients with three or more risk alleles in XRCC1 and XRCC3 had a significantly increased risk of developing normal tissue reactions (odds ratio 10.10, p = 0.001). The mean number of chromatid breaks per cell was significantly greater in patients with normal tissue reactions than in patients with no reactions (1.16 and 1.34, respectively; p = 0.002). Patients with high chromosomal radiosensitivity showed a 9.2-fold greater annual risk of complications than patients with intermediate chromosomal radiosensitivity. Combining the G2 analysis with the risk allele model allowed us to identify 23% of the patients with late normal tissue reactions, without false-positive results. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study showed that clinical radiosensitivity is associated with an enhanced G2 chromosomal radiosensitivity and is significantly associated with a combination of different polymorphisms in DNA repair genes.

All patients received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiation (RT), and 80 patients also received modified infusional 5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Toxicity from neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NT) increases morbidity and limits therapeutic efficacy in patients with rectal cancer. The objective of this study was to determine whether specific polymorphisms in genes associated with rectal cancer response to NT were correlated with NT-related toxicity. METHODS: One hundred thirty-two patients with locally advanced rectal cancer received NT followed by surgery. All patients received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiation (RT), and 80 patients also received modified infusional 5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6). Grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) that occurred during 5-FU/RT and during combined 5-FU/RT + mFOLFOX-6 were recorded. Pretreatment biopsy specimens and normal rectal tissues were collected from all patients. DNA was extracted and screened for 22 polymorphisms in 17 genes that have been associated with response to NT. Polymorphisms were correlated with treatment-related grade ≥3 AEs. RESULTS: Overall, 27 of 132 patients (20%) had grade ≥3 AEs; 18 patients had a complication associated only with 5-FU/RT, 3 patients experienced toxicity only during mFOLFOX-6, and 6 patients had grade ≥3 AEs associated with both treatments before surgery. Polymorphisms in the genes x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1), xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) were associated with grade ≥3 AEs during NT (P < .05). Specifically, 2 polymorphisms-an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 399 (Q399R) in XRCC1 and a lysine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 751 (K751Q) in XPD-were associated with increased toxicity to 5-FU/RT (P < .05), and an arginine-to-proline substitution at codon 72 (R72P) in TP53 was associated with increased toxicity to mFOLFOX-6 (P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Specific polymorphisms in XRCC1, XPD, and TP53 were associated with increased toxicity to NT in patients with rectal cancer. The current results indicated that polymorphism screening may help tailor treatment for patients by selecting therapies with the lowest risk of toxicity, thus increasing patient compliance.

155	Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene for XRCC1 and radiation-induced late toxicity in prostate cancer patients	English	2011	21345510	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345510	Journal Article	\N	603	603	\N	\N	\N	\N	High energy photons (18 MV) were generally delivered in a three-ﬁeld technique using an anterior and two lateral ﬁelds. A subgroup of patients (n = 110) was treated with salvage radiotherapy for biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy using high energy photons (18 MV) in a conformal three-ﬁeld technique. The remaining patients (n = 493) received deﬁnitive radiation treatment for prostate cancer with high energy photons (18MV) in a three-ﬁeld technique to encompass the prostate and seminal vesicles. All ﬁelds were treated daily, 5 days/week. The total dose prescribed to the 95% isodose value at the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement point was 66–70.4 Gy delivered in 1.8–2 Gy per fraction. At the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist 111 patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Polymorphisms in genes responsible for DNA damage signaling and repair might modulate DNA repair capacity and, therefore, affect cell and tissue response to radiation and influence individual radiosensitivity. The purpose of the present prospective investigation was to evaluate the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms in XRCC1 with radiation-induced late side effects in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To analyze the role of XRCC1 polymorphisms for late toxicity 603 participants from the Austrian PROCAGENE study treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy were included in the present investigation. Three non-synonymous candidate polymorphisms in the X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene (Arg194Trp; Arg280His; Arg399Gln) were selected and determined by 5´-nuclease (TaqMan) assays. RESULTS: Within a median follow-up time of 35 months, 91 patients (15.7%) developed high-grade late toxicities (defined as late bladder and/or rectal toxicity RTOG≥2). In a Kaplan-Meier analysis, carriers of the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism were at decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity (p=0.022), in multivariate analysis including clinical and dosimetric parameters as potential confounders the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism remained a significant predictor for high-grade late toxicity (HR=0.221, 95% CI 0.051-0.956; p=0.043). No significant associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the XRCC1 Arg280His polymorphism may be protective against the development of high-grade late toxicity after radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients.

The regimen (based on Shipley's method with slight modification) for one cycle was cisplatini (70 mg/㎡) on day 1, with radiation at 1.8 Gy per fraction from day 2-5 in the first week, and on 5 consecutive dats in the second week. Radiotherapy involved 10 MV photons with a four-field technique treating the bladder and pelvic nodes to 32.4 Gy during two cycles, followed by computerized tomography planned whole bladder boost of 16.2 Gy for an additional cycle. All patients received 0.3 mg ramosetron, a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, before and after cisplatin infusion.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	AIMS: Platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) as bladder conservation therapy has shown promising results for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, treatment-related toxicity remains a major consideration in therapeutic planning. Some common polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair (encoding enzymes that repair DNA damaged by platinum agents and ionizing radiation) are reported to result in modulation of the repair capacity. We investigated associations between functional genetic polymorphisms involved in DNA repair and acute toxicity of CRT to determine the predictive value of these polymorphisms for toxicity. MATERIALS & METHODS: The study group comprised of 101 bladder cancer patients treated with platinum-based CRT, and seven polymorphisms in XPC (Lys939Gln, rs2228001), XPD (Lys751Gln, rs13181), XPG (Asp1104His, rs17655), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln, rs25487), XRCC3 (Thr241Met, rs861539), TP53 (Arg72Pro, rs1042522) and MDM2 (SNP309, T>G, rs2279744) were genotyped. RESULTS: More than two total variant alleles in nucleotide excision repair genes, including XPC, XPD and XPG, were significantly associated with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 6.8; 95% CI: 2.0-26; p = 0.0026). There were no significant associations between any genotypes and grade 2 or greater nausea/vomiting or diarrhea. Any grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity was significantly associated with the Gln/Gln or Lys/Gln + Gln/Gln genotypes of XPC compared with Lys/Lys (aOR: 10; 95% CI: 2.0-65; p = 0.0070 or aOR: 6.3; 95% CI: 1.9-29; p = 0.0069; respectively). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that nucleotide excision repair gene polymorphisms, especially in XPC, might potentially be predictive factors for acute toxicity of CRT for bladder cancer, helping individual patient selection for bladder conservation therapy. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to draw final conclusions.	Pharmacogenomics	Stage II: 24 patients, Stage III: 77 patients.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes associated with DNA repair, cell cycle, transforming growth factor-β, tumor necrosis factor and receptor, folic acid metabolism, and angiogenesis can significantly improve the fit of the Lyman-Kutcher-Burman (LKB) normal-tissue complication probability (NTCP) model of radiation pneumonitis (RP) risk among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixteen SNPs from 10 different genes (XRCC1, XRCC3, APEX1, MDM2, TGFβ, TNFα, TNFR, MTHFR, MTRR, and VEGF) were genotyped in 141 NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy. The LKB model was used to estimate the risk of severe (grade≥3) RP as a function of mean lung dose (MLD), with SNPs and patient smoking status incorporated into the model as dose-modifying factors. Multivariate analyses were performed by adding significant factors to the MLD model in a forward stepwise procedure, with significance assessed using the likelihood-ratio test. Bootstrap analyses were used to assess the reproducibility of results under variations in the data. RESULTS: Five SNPs were selected for inclusion in the multivariate NTCP model based on MLD alone. SNPs associated with an increased risk of severe RP were in genes for TGFβ, VEGF, TNFα, XRCC1 and APEX1. With smoking status included in the multivariate model, the SNPs significantly associated with increased risk of RP were in genes for TGFβ, VEGF, and XRCC3. Bootstrap analyses selected a median of 4 SNPs per model fit, with the 6 genes listed above selected most often. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that SNPs can significantly improve the predictive ability of the Lyman MLD model. With a small number of SNPs, it was possible to distinguish cohorts with >50% risk vs <10% risk of RP when they were exposed to high MLDs.

Radiotherapy	5	The study goal was to examine the association of three polymorphisms in the XRCC1 gene (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, and Arg399Gln) involved in repairing DNA damage produced by ionizing radiation, a known breast cancer (BC) risk factor, with BC incidence and the possibility of developing an adverse radiotherapy response. Genomic DNA from 254 BC cases, 70 of whom were adverse radiotherapy responders [radiation-sensitive breast cancer (RS-BC) patients], and 312 female blood donors were genotyped using either TaqMan technology or variant specific restriction enzyme digestion. Neither the exon 6 codon 194Trp allele [BC versus controls: odds ratio (OR), 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62-1.67] nor the exon 10 codon 399Gln allele (BC versus controls: OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.74-1.23) alone was associated with an increased BC risk. The exon 9 codon 280His allele was associated with an increased risk (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.07-3.05) in both the radiation-sensitive and non-radiation-sensitive cases and, in combination with the 399Gln allele, was found more frequently in cases than in controls (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.04-6.22). The exon 6 194Trp allele was associated with the risk of developing an adverse response to radiotherapy (RS-BC versus non-radiation-sensitive BC: OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 0.92-4.17). This allele, in combination with the 399Gln allele, was found more frequently in RS-BC cases than in the non-radiation-sensitive BC cases (OR, 4.33; 95% CI, 1.24-15.12). Distinct combinations of XRCC1 polymorphisms appear to be associated with either an increased BC risk or the possibility of developing an adverse radiotherapy response seen in some BC patients.

Adjuvant hormone-therapy, with Tamoxifen (6 pts), Anastrozole (38 pts) or Letrozole (8 pts), as indicated, were given simultaneously with single shot partial breast irradiation (SSPBI).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: To evaluate the association between polymorphisms involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress genes and mean dose to whole breast on acute skin reactions (erythema) in breast cancer (BC) patients following single shot partial breast irradiation (SSPBI) after breast conservative surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Acute toxicity was assessed using vers.3 criteria. single nucleotides polymorphisms(SNPs) in genes: XRCC1(Arg399Gln/Arg194Trp), XRCC3 (A4541G-5'UTR/Thr241Met), GSTP1(Ile105Val), GSTA1 and RAD51(untranslated region). SNPs were determined in 57 BC patients by the Pyrosequencing analysis. Univariate(ORs and 95% CI) and logistic multivariate analyses (MVA) were performed to correlate polymorphic genes with the risk of developing acute skin reactions to radiotherapy. RESULTS: After SSPBI on the tumour bed following conservative surgery, grade 1 or 2 acute erythema was observed in 19 pts(33%). Univariate analysis indicated a higher significant risk of developing erythema in patients with polymorphic variant wt XRCC1Arg194Trp, mut/het XRCC3Thr241Met, wt/het XRCC3A4541G-5'UTR. Similarly a higher erythema rate was also found in the presence of mut/het of XRCC1Arg194Trp or wt of GSTA1. Whereas, a lower erythema rate was observed in patients with mut/het of XRCC1Arg194Trp or wt of XRCC1Arg399Gln. The mean dose to whole breast(p = 0.002), the presence of either mut/het XRCC1Arg194Trp or wt XRCC3Thr241Met (p = 0.006) and the presence of either mut/het XRCC1Arg194Trp or wt GSTA1(p = 0.031) were confirmed as predictors of radiotherapy-induced erythema by MVA. CONCLUSIONS: The Whole breast mean dose together with the presence of some polymorphic genes involved in DNA repair or oxidative stress could explain the erythema observed after SSPBI, but further studies are needed to confirm these results in a larger cohort.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) has been implicated in several inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. We hypothesized that genetic variations in the MMP1 promoter region are associated with risk of radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). A cohort of 251 lung cancer patients was genotyped for five single nucleotide polymorphisms in the MMP1 promoter region. We found that rs1144393 AG/GG was strongly correlated with an increased occurrence of grade ≥ 2 RILI (p = 0.002). Additionally, patients with the rs1144393 AG/GG genotypes exhibited higher MMP-1 expression than patients with the AA genotype in lung tissues (n = 28, p = 0.022) and plasma samples (n = 40, p = 0.018). Our results indicated that rs1144393 in the MMP1 promoter region can be a predictor of grade ≥ 2 RILI in lung cancer patients treated with thoracic radiation.

161	Association of a XRCC3 polymorphism and rectum mean dose with the risk of acute radio-inducedgastrointestinal toxicity in prostate cancer patients	English	2012	23075580	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23075580	Journal Article	Galician	698	698	\N	\N	71	[47.0,86.0)	Patients were treated in seven coplanar ﬁelds using 15 MV photons. The dose was administered in 1.8–2 Gy/fraction. Those patients that were prescribed with radical radiotherapy received a total dose for the PTV I that ranged 70–76 Gy, as well as 56 Gy for the PTV II and 46 Gy for PTV III if necessary, as previously de- scribed. Total dose for salvage radiotherapy and for adjuvant radiotherapy was prescribed in a unique PTV that ranged between 66–70 Gy and 60–66 Gy respectively. Dosage was calculated so that 95% of CTV and at least 90% of PTV received the corresponding prescriptions. The maximum dose heterogeneity allowable inside the PTV was 17% (90–107%). Dose–volume constraints were as follows: V70, V65 and V50 less than 15%, 30% and 50%, and less than 5% 25% and 50%, for the rectal and bladder walls respectively. Setup accuracy was monitored daily by veriﬁcation of the isocenter position by means of digitally reconstructed radiography through orthogonal portal images. Isocenter placement errors were corrected onine if they were P 3 mm. In addition to the radiotherapy treat- ment, neoadjuvant and adjuvant hormonal therapy was prescribed for intermediate (3–6 months) and high risk patients (2 years).	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We have performed a case-control study among prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformational radiotherapy (3D-CRT) in order to investigate the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), treatment and patient features with gastrointestinal and genitourinary acute toxicity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 698 patients were screened for 14 SNPs located in the ATM, ERCC2, LIG4, MLH1 and XRCC3 genes. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were recorded prospectively using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. RESULTS: The XRCC3 SNP rs1799794 (G/G OR=5.65; 95% CI: 1.95-16.38; G/A OR=2.75; 95% CI: 1.25-6.05; uncorrected p-value=2.8×10(-03); corrected p-value=0.03; FDR q-value=0.06) as well as the mean dose received by the rectum (OR=1.06; 95% CI: 1.02-1.1; uncorrected p-value=2.49×10(-03); corrected p-value=0.03; FDR q-value=0.06) were significantly associated with gastrointestinal toxicity after correction for multiple testing. Those patients who undergone previous prostatectomy were less prone to develop genitourinary toxicity (OR=0.38; 95% CI: 0.18-0.71; uncorrected p-value=4.95×10(-03); corrected p-value=0.03; FDR q-value=0.08). Our study excludes the possibility of a >2-fold risk increase in genitourinary acute toxicity being due to rs1801516 ATM SNP, the rs1805386 and rs1805388 LIG4 markers, as well as all the SNPs evaluated in the ERCC2, MLH1 and XRCC3 genes. CONCLUSIONS: The XRCC3 rs1799794 SNP and the mean dose received by the rectum are associated with the development of gastrointestinal toxicity after 3D-CRT.

200	Genetic predictors of long-term toxicities after radiation therapy for breast cancer	English	2008	18027873	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18027873	Journal Article	\N	390	\N	390	\N	64.5	[31.0,84.0)	Briefly, women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and received breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation treatment. All patients received a standard breast irradiation treatment with conformal tangential irradiation with lateral and medial wedge ﬁelds, including CT-based planning, simulation, veriﬁcation and quality assurance, with slight differences across the participating radiotherapy units. At three hospitals, the standard regimen included irradiation of the whole breast, either 50 Gy given in 5 x 2.0 Gy fractions or 50.4 Gy in 5 x 1.8 Gy fractions per week, followed by a photon or electron boost with doses ranging from 5 to 20 Gy. Three patients were treated with brachytherapy (20 or 25 Gy). In the fourth radiation department, patients received 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation in 5 x 2.0 Gy fractions without boost.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Telangiectasia and subcutaneous fibrosis are the most common late dermatologic side effects observed in response to radiation treatment. Radiotherapy acts on cancer cells largely due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS also induce normal tissue toxicities. Therefore, we investigated if genetic variation in oxidative stress-related enzymes confers increased susceptibility to late skin complications. Women who received radiotherapy following lumpectomy for breast cancer were followed prospectively for late tissue side effects after initial treatment. Final analysis included 390 patients. Polymorphisms in genes involved in oxidative stress-related mechanisms (GSTA1, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, MPO, MnSOD, eNOS, CAT) were determined from blood samples by MALDI-TOF. The associations between telangiectasia and genotypes were evaluated by multivariate unconditional logistic regression models. Patients with variant GSTA1 genotypes were at significantly increased risk of telangiectasia (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.11-3.11). Reduced odds ratios of telangiectasia were noted for women with lower-activity eNOS genotype (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.93). Genotype effects were modified by follow-up time, with the highest risk observed after 4 years of radiotherapy for gene polymorphisms in ROS-neutralizing enzymes. Decreased risk with eNOS polymorphisms was significant only among women with less than 4 years of follow-up. All other risk estimates were nonsignificant. Late effects of radiation therapy on skin appear to be modified by variants in genes related to protection from oxidative stress. The application of genomics to outcomes following radiation therapy holds the promise of radiation dose adjustment to improve both cosmetic outcomes and quality of life for breast cancer patients.

162	XRCC3 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of developing radiation-induced latexerostomia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with intensity modulation radiatedtherapy	English	2014	24453273	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24453273	Journal Article	\N	103	38	65	53	\N	[18.0,78.0)	All patients received IMRT (intensity modulation radiated therapy)  as deﬁnitive treatment without concurrent chemotherapy. Patients with locally advanced disease received two cycles of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy containing cisplatin and taxol.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	OBJECTIVE: The incidence of radiation-induced late xerostomia varies greatly in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy. The single-nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and fibroblast proliferation may be correlated with such variability. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the association between the risk of developing radiation-induced late xerostomia and four genetic polymorphisms: TGFβ1 C-509T, TGFβ1 T869C, XRCC3 722C>T and ATM 5557G>A in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with Intensity Modulation Radiated Therapy. METHODS: The severity of late xerostomia was assessed using a patient self-reported validated xerostomia questionnaire. Polymerase chain reaction-ligation detection reaction methods were performed to determine individual genetic polymorphism. The development of radiation-induced xerostomia associated with genetic polymorphisms was modeled using Cox proportional hazards, accounting for equivalent uniform dose. RESULTS: A total of 43 (41.7%) patients experienced radiation-induced late xerostomia. Univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses showed a higher risk of late xerostomia for patients with XRCC3 722 TT/CT alleles. In multivariate analysis adjusted for clinical and dosimetric factors, XRCC3 722C>T polymorphisms remained a significant factor for higher risk of late xerostomia. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrated an association between genetic polymorphisms and the risk of radiation-induced late xerostomia in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with Intensity Modulation Radiated Therapy. Our findings suggest that the polymorphisms in XRCC3 are significantly associated with the risk of developing radiation-induced late xerostomia.

163	Association of TGF-β1 and XPD polymorphisms with severe acute radiation-induced esophagealtoxicity in locally advanced lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy	English	2010	20832885	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20832885	Journal Article	\N	213	177	36	60	\N	[34.0,83.0)	All patients received radiotherapy with 6-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator (Varian 600CD, Palo Alto, CA). A total dose of 50–70 Gy was given with 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days a week. Among 213 patients, all of them were treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT). CT simulation (Somaton, Siemens, Berlin, Germany) was performed before planning the treatment. After the images were transferred to a 3D planning system (Pinnacle 3 version 8.0d), the target volumes and critical normal organs were delineated.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET) is a dose-limiting toxicity in lung cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Accumulating evidence indicates that DNA repair and the cytokine pathways play essential roles in radiation-induced diseases. Genetic polymorphisms of genes in these pathways may affect gene function and/or gene expression and lead to different treatment-related esophageal toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study investigated the association of 21 polymorphisms in 14 genes, with the occurrence of ≥ grade 2 acute RIET. Genotypes were analyzed among 213 stage III lung cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. RESULTS: We used Cox proportional hazard model to examine the effects of genotypes on ≥ grade 2 acute RIET risk and Kaplan-Meier estimator to compare effects of different genotypes on such risk. Multivariate analysis showed that CT or TT genotype of TGF-β1-509C/T polymorphism was associated with a significantly higher RIET risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.17-5.24; P=0.018, or HR=3.86; 95% CI=1.50-9.92; P=0.005), respectively, compared with the CC genotype. Moreover, Lys/Gln+Gln/Gln genotypes of XPD Lys751Gln polymorphism were also associated with a significantly decreased RIET risk (adjusted HR=0.55; 95% CI=0.32-0.96; P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: This report, for the first time, examined the influence of inherited variation in the DNA repair and the cytokine pathways on RIET.

164	Genetic variation in radiation and platinum pathways predicts severe acute radiation toxicity in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma treated with cisplatin-based preoperative radiochemotherapy: results from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 	English	2011	21286719	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21286719	Journal Article	White; Black; Hispanic; Asian	60	53	7	57	\N	[38.0,76.0)	Subjects received in both arms radiotherapy to 45 Gy administered at 1.8 Gy per day, 5 days a week for 5 weeks, concurrent with chemotherapy. One arm received cisplatin 30 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 22, 29, and irinotecan 65 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 22, 29. The other arm received cisplatin 30 mg/㎡ days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and paclitaxel 50 mg/㎡ (1 h) days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29. Subjects in both arms underwent surgical resection about 5 weeks after the completion of RCT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Germline genetic variations may partly explain the clinical observation that normal tissue tolerance to radiochemotherapy varies by individual. Our objective was to evaluate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in radiation/platinum pathways and serious treatment-related toxicity in subjects with esophageal adenocarcinoma who received cisplatin-based preoperative radiochemotherapy. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial (E1201), 81 eligible treatment-naïve subjects with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma received cisplatin-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiotherapy, with planned subsequent surgical resection. Toxicity endpoints were defined as grade ≥3 radiation-related or myelosuppressive events probably or definitely related to therapy, occurring during or up to 6 weeks following the completion of radiochemotherapy. SNPs were analyzed in 60 subjects in pathways related to nucleotide/base excision- or double stranded break repair, or platinum influx, efflux, or detoxification. RESULTS: Grade ≥3 radiation-related toxicity (mostly dysphagia) and myelosuppression occurred in 18 and 33% of subjects, respectively. The variant alleles of the XRCC2 5' flanking SNP (detected in 28% of subjects) and of GST-Pi Ile-105-Val (detected in 65% of subjects) were each associated with higher odds of serious radiation-related toxicity compared to the major allele homozygote (47% vs. 9%, and 31% vs. 0%, respectively; P = 0.005). No SNP was associated with myelosuppression. CONCLUSIONS: This novel finding in a well-characterized cohort with robust endpoint data supports further investigation of XRCC2 and GST-Pi as potential predictors of radiation toxicity.

Iridium implants were used to a dose of 60 to 65 Gy, using the guide gutter technique and the Paris system of dosimetry prescribing to the 85% reference isodose where the mandible was considered to be in the ﬁeld. Seven patients received concurrent cisplatin and 5-ﬂuorouracil in addition to radiotherapy. No patient received therapy targeted to the epidermal growth factor. The patients at Liverpool had all undergone primary surgery and postoperative radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions to the tumor site. In Manchester, patients whose primary tumors had not been resected surgically received between 50 and 52.5 Gy in 16 fractions. Patients who had surgical resection of their primary tumor or whose parotid gland was treated received 50 Gy in 20 fractions.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: We performed a case-control study to establish whether the development of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) was related to a variant allele substituting T for C at -509 of the transforming growth factor-β1 gene (TGF-β1). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 140 patients, 39 with and 101 without ORN, who underwent radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer with a minimum of 2 years follow-up, were studied. None of the patients had clinical evidence of recurrence at this time. DNA extracted from blood was genotyped for the -509 C-T variant allele of the TGF-β1 gene. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in patient, cancer treatment, or tumor characteristics between the two groups. Of the 39 patients who developed ORN, 9 were homozygous for the common CC allele, 19 were heterozygous, and 11 were homozygous for the rare TT genotype. Of the 101 patients without ORN, the distribution was 56 (CC), 33 (CT), and 12 (TT). The difference in distribution was significant, giving an increased risk of ORN of 5.7 (95% CI, 1.7-19.2) for homozygote TT patients (p = 0.001) and 3.6 (95% CI, 1.3-10.0) for heterozygotes (p = 0.004) when compared with patients with the CC genotype. Postradiotherapy dentoalveolar surgery preceding the development of ORN was associated with the CC genotype (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the postulate that the development of ORN is related to the presence of the T variant allele at -509 within the TGF-β1 gene.

166	Involvement of mitochondrial DNA sequence variations and respiratory activity in latecomplications following radiotherapy	English	2009	19920115	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19920115	Journal Article	\N	32	4	28	51	\N	[19.0,69.0)	The treatment was standardized and involved definitive radiotherapy with no surgery. Locally advanced stages also received standard neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatinum and epirubicin; ref. 18). Total radiation dose to the upper neck was 66 Gy (positive lymph nodes) delivered using 2 Gy per fraction per day over 6.5 wk. Where possible, some patients (n = 10) received a boost of two additional fractions to the nasopharynx to bring the dose received to 70 Gy in 7 wk.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Mitochondria and ionizing radiation overlap in a number of features; for instance, both generate harmful reactive oxygen species, and that radiation can induce cell death through the intermediary of mitochondria. Because a number of genetic variations in nuclear genes are frequently associated with response to cancer treatment, the aim of this case-control study was to test the hypothesis that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genetic variations can contribute to patient-to-patient variability in normal tissue response to radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirty-two nasopharyngeal carcinomas patients treated with definitive radiotherapy were included. The grade (G) of s.c. and deep tissue fibrosis was scored according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer grading system. Coding and RNA mtDNA (between 611 and 15,978 bp) were sequenced, and genetic variations were scored. Mitochondrial respiratory activity was measured by resazurin reduction assay. RESULTS: Data showed a significantly (P = 0.003) higher number of nonsynonymous genetic variations in the radiosensitive (G(2)-G(3); 16 patients) as compared with the control (G(0)-G(1); 16 patients) groups. The nonsynonymous A10398G variation in the ND3 gene was significantly associated with fibrotic reaction (P = 0.01). The radiosensitive patients had a 7-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.16-51.65) higher risk of developing moderate to severe fibrosis (G(2)-G(3)) following radiotherapy. This was significantly correlated with lower mitochondrial respiratory activity (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Mitochondria contribute to radiation sensitivity, and genetic variations can be associated with late reactions to radiotherapy. Predictive markers of radiosensitivity should take into account mtDNA genetic variations in addition to variations in nuclear genes.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N
167	Significant associations of mismatch repair gene polymorphisms with clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer	English	2009	19237629	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19237629	Journal Article	White; Hispanic; Black; Other	154	96	58	\N	\N	\N	The patients from the ID98-020 trial (N=70) had received chemoradiotherapy with seven weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of gencitabine (400 mg/㎡ IV over 30 minutes) plus radiationo therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks). For the patients from the ID01-341 trial (N=84), chemotherapy consisted of gemcitabine (750 mg/㎡) and cisplatin (30 mg/㎡) given every 2 weeks for four doses. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of four weeklt infusions of gemcitabine (400 mg/㎡) combined with radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions administered over 2 weeks) delivered 5 days per week.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is critical in maintaining genomic stability and may modulate the cellular response to gemcitabine. We hypothesized that genetic variations in MMR may affect the clinical outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of eight MMR genes in 154 patients with potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who were enrolled onto phase II clinical trials for preoperative gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy from 1999 to 2006. Associations of genotypes with tumor response to therapy (change of tumor size by radiologic evaluation at restaging), margin-negative tumor resection, and overall survival were evaluated using logistic regression and Cox proportional regression models. RESULTS: Five, six, and 10 genotypes were significantly associated with tumor response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy, tumor resectability, and overall survival, respectively, in univariable analysis. TREX1 EX14-460C>T and TP73 Ex2+4G>A genotypes remained as significant predictors for tumor response, MLH1 IVS12-169C>T and TP73 remained as significant predictors for tumor resectability, and EXO1 R354H, TREX1, and TP73 remained as significant predictors for overall survival in multivariable models that included all clinical factors and genotypes examined. A strong combined genotype effect on each clinical end point was observed. For example, 20 of the 25 patients with zero to one adverse genotypes were alive, those with two, three, four, five, and six to seven adverse genotypes had median survival times of 36.2, 23.9, 16.3, 13.0, and 8.3 months, respectively (P < .001). CONCLUSION: SNPs of MMR genes have a potential value as predictors for clinical response to chemoradiotherapy and as prognostic markers for tumor resectability and overall survival of patients with resectable pancreatic cancer.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	We examined the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at miRNA binding sites in the 3'-UTRs of genes in the apoptosis pathway on the prognosis of patients with limited disease-small cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC). Twelve tagSNPs in seven genes were genotyped using blood samples from 146 LD-SCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Cox proportional hazard regression models and recursive partitioning analysis were performed to identify SNPs significantly associated with overall survival. Three SNPs, CASP8: rs1045494 (C > T), PIK3R1: rs3756668 (A > G) and CASP7: rs4353229 (T > C), were associated with longer overall survival in LD-SCLC patients after chemoradiotherapy. The adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 0.480 (0.258-0.894), 0.405 (0.173-0.947) and 0.446 (0.247-0.802), respectively, and remained significant after multiple comparison correction. Moreover, subset analysis showed these SNPs were still predictive of overall survival in stage III patients. Recursive partitioning analysis enabled patients to be classified into three risk subgroups based on unfavorable genotype combinations of the rs1045494 and rs4353229 SNPs. These findings suggest miRNA-related polymorphisms in the apoptosis pathway may be useful biomarkers for selection of LD-SCLC patients likely to benefit from chemoradiotherapy.

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a pleiotropic cytokine that has diverse roles in cancer. Rate of production of the major isoform, TGF-beta1, is linked with rs1982073 single nucleotide polymorphism in TGFB1 gene signal sequence. METHODS: Peripheral blood DNA of 175 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients were genotyped using real-time PCR and fluorescent probes. The median follow-up time was 2.9 years (range, 0.1-15.9 years). Survival was assessed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Among the 38 patients who had received chemoradiotherapy without surgical resection the high-producer TGFB1 genotypes CC and CT were associated with a better disease-free and overall survival when compared with the low-producer TT genotype (hazard ratios for interaction 3.42, 95% CI 1.12-10.5 and 3.09, 95% CI 0.96-10.0, respectively). CONCLUSION: Genetic polymorphism of the TGFB1 signal sequence is associated with the response to chemoradiotherapy. TGF-beta1 may sensitize cancer stem cells to chemoradiotherapy.

170	ATM polymorphisms are associated with risk of radiation-induced pneumonitis	English	2010	20171797	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20171797	Journal Article	\N	253	207	46	\N	\N	\N	All patients received radiotherapy with 6-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator (600CD model; Varian, Palo Alto, CA). A total dose ranging from 50 to 70 Gy was given with 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week. Among 253 patients, 206 patients received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, whereas 47 patients received two-dimensional radiotherapy. Computed tomography (CT) simulation (Somaton, Siemens, Berlin, Germany) was performed before planning the treatment. After the images were transferred to a three-dimensional planning system (Pinnacle 3, version 8.0d), the target volumes and critical normal organs were delineated. The lung volume receiving >20 Gy (V20) was limited to 25% to 30% according to individual general performance, pulmonary func- tion, and treatment schedules.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Since the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein plays crucial roles in repair of double-stranded DNA breaks, control of cell cycle checkpoints, and radiosensitivity, we hypothesized that variations in this gene might be associated with radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP). METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 253 lung cancer patients receiving thoracic irradiation between 2004 and 2006 were included in this study. Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 was used to grade RP. Five haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ATM gene were genotyped using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of RP for genotypes were computed by the Cox model, adjusted for clinical factors. The function of the ATM SNP associated with RP was examined by biochemical assays. RESULTS: During the median 22-month follow-up, 44 (17.4%) patients developed grade > or = 2 RP. In multivariate Cox regression models adjusted for other clinical predictors, we found two ATM variants were independently associated with increased RP risk. They were an 111G > A) polymorphism (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.07-5.80) and an ATM 126713G > A polymorphism (HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.16-5.28). Furthermore, genotype-dependent differences in ATM expression were demonstrated both in cell lines (p < 0.001) and in individual lung tissue samples (p = 0.003), which supported the results of the association study. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic polymorphisms of ATM are significantly associated with RP risk. These variants might exert their effect through regulation of ATM expression and serve as independent biomarkers for prediction of RP in patients treated with thoracic radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The dysregulation of gene expression in the TNF-TNFR superfamily has been involved in various human cancers including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Furthermore, functional polymorphisms in TNF-α and TNFRSF1B genes that alter gene expression are likely to be associated with risk and clinical outcomes of cancers. However, few reported studies have investigated the association between potentially functional SNPs in both TNF-α and TNFRSF1B and prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: We genotyped five potentially functional polymorphisms of TNF-α and TNFRSF1B genes [TNF-α -308 G>A (rs1800629) and -1031 T>C (rs1799964); TNFRSF1B +676 T>G (rs1061622), -1709A>T(rs652625) and +1663A>G (rs1061624)] in 225 NSCLC patients treated with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between these variants and NSCLC overall survival (OS). RESULTS: We found that the TNFRSF1B +676 GG genotype was associated with a significantly better OS of NSCLC (GG vs. TT: adjusted HR = 0.38, 95% CI = 0.15-0.94; GG vs. GT/TT: adjusted HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.88). Further stepwise multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the TNFRSF1B +676 GG was an independent prognosis predictor in this NSCLC cohort (GG vs. GT/TT: HR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.14-0.85), in the presence of node status (N2-3 vs. N0-1: HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 1.09-2.35) and tumor stage (T3-4 vs. T0-2: HR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.08-2.03). CONCLUSIONS: Although the exact biological function for this SNP remains to be explored, our findings suggest a possible role of TNFRSF1B +676 T>G (rs1061622) in the prognosis of NSCLC. Further large and functional studies are needed to confirm our findings.	BMC Cancer	Stage I-II: 33 patients, Stage III-IV: 192 patients.
172	Novel single-nucleotide polymorphism markers predictive of pathologic response to preoperative chemoradiation therapy in rectal cancer patients	English	2013	23490283	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23490283	Journal Article	\N	113	76	37	\N	59	\N	Preoperative radiation therapy was delivered to the pelvis using the 3-ﬁeld box technique. Patients received 45 Gy in 25 fractions, followed by a boost to the primary tumor of 5.4 Gy in 3 fractions over 5 weeks, in accordance with a previously published protocol. Patients received concurrent chemotherapy consisting of 2 cycles of bolus intravenous 5-ﬂuorouracil (375 mg/㎡/day) with leucovorin (20 mg/㎡/day) in 92 patients and oral capecitabine (825 mg/㎡ twice daily) in 21 patients. Clinical stage and tumor regression grade (TRG) did not differ between the 5-ﬂuorouracil with leucovorin and capecitabine groups (PZ1 and PZ.942, respectively). All patients underwent curative operations 4 to 8 weeks after CRT.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Studies aimed at predicting individual responsiveness to preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT) are urgently needed, especially considering the risks associated with poorly responsive patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 3-step strategy for the determination of CRT sensitivity is proposed based on (1) the screening of a human genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array in correlation with histopathologic tumor regression grade (TRG); (2) clinical association analysis of 113 patients treated with preoperative CRT; and (3) a cell-based functional assay for biological validation. RESULTS: Genome-wide screening identified 9 SNPs associated with preoperative CRT responses. Positive responses (TRG 1-3) were obtained more frequently in patients carrying the reference allele (C) of the SNP CORO2A rs1985859 than in those with the substitution allele (T) (P=.01). Downregulation of CORO2A was significantly associated with reduced early apoptosis by 27% (P=.048) and 39% (P=.023) in RKO and COLO320DM colorectal cancer cells, respectively, as determined by flow cytometry. Reduced radiosensitivity was confirmed by colony-forming assays in the 2 colorectal cancer cells (P=.034 and .015, respectively). The SNP FAM101A rs7955740 was not associated with radiosensitivity in the clinical association analysis. However, downregulation of FAM101A significantly reduced early apoptosis by 29% in RKO cells (P=.047), and it enhanced colony formation in RKO cells (P=.001) and COLO320DM cells (P=.002). CONCLUSION: CRT-sensitive SNP markers were identified using a novel 3-step process. The candidate marker CORO2A rs1985859 and the putative marker FAM101A rs7955740 may be of value for the prediction of radiosensitivity to preoperative CRT, although further validation is needed in large cohorts.

Methods: Sixty cases first-treated patients with PSEC were recruited, patients with esophageal squamous cellcarcinoma (ESCC) and health blood donors were recruited as positive and negative controls. APE1 (Asp148Glu) of the patients with PSEC and controls were genotyped by the TaqMan method. Every patient was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (EP regimen for PSEC and TP regimen for ESCC) and radiotherapy (3D-RCT), then every case was followed-up for 2 years. The relationship between these SNPs and the follow-up outcome was analyzed. Results: Compared with the ESCC group and control group, APE1 148 pure mutant (Glu/Glu) of PSEC group increased significantly (PSEC group was 40% (12/30), ESCC group was 13.3% (4/30), control group was 10% (2/20)), the difference was statistically significantly (chi-square=7.248, P=0.027). According to data of following-up, there was a sifnificant increase in rate of progress (1 year: 40.0% (12/30) vs 16.7% (5/30), chi-squar=4.022, P=0.045; 2 years): 86.7% (26/30) vs 40.0% (12/30), P=0.004) and a significant decrease in survival (33.3% (10/30) vs 76.7% (23/30)) of PESC compared with ESCC. The SNPs of APE1 Asp148Glu was significantly correlated with frequency of progress, a significant iincrease was found in rate of progress of the patients with mutant type (Asp/Glu+Glu/Glu) compared with wild genotype (1 year: 50.0% (11/22), chi-square=3.854, P=0.05, 2 years: 81.8% (19/22), chi-square=10.519, P=0.001), the survival of patients with mutant genotype was significantly lower than wild type (22.7% (5/22), chi-square=10.77, P=0.001). Conclusion: The most of polymorphisms of APE1 (Asp148Glu) are mutation type in PSEC. Pure mutant genotype (APE1 Asp148Glu) carry significant enhancement of progression. The polymorphisms of APE1 (Asp148Glu) maybe one of these molecular mechanisms of high frequency of progress and poor prognosis in PSEC.	Clinical Medicine of China	\N
174	Correlation between microRNA polymorphism and the risk and clinical prognosis of acute radiation esophagitis in patients with esophageal neoplasms	Chinese	2016	\N	http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/details/detail.do?_type=perio&id=zlyjylc201602006	Journal Article	\N	512	276	236	\N	\N	[37.0,72.0)	\N	Radiotherapy	5	Objective: To study the correlation between microRNA (miRNA) polymorphism and the risk and clinical prognosis of acute radiation esophagitis in patients with esophageal neoplasms. Methods: 256 patients with acute radiation esophagitis during radiotherapy were chosen as the experimental group, and 256 patients matched by age and sex without acute radiation esophagitis during radiotherapy were chosen as the control group. The polymorphism types of miRNA-146a (rs2910164) were determined by Taqman gene typing technology of ABI7900HT. The genotype distribution of miRNA-146a rs2910164 polymorphism in the experimental and control groups was analyzed. Logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI ). Results: The genotype frequencies of CC, GG and CG at miRNA-146a polymorphic site rs2910164 in the experiment and control group were 20.70 % (53/256) and 33.20 % (85/256), 45.32 % (116/256) and 40.63 % (104/256), 33.98 % (87/256) and 26.17 % (67/256), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between two groups (all P < 0.05). Compared with gene type CC, the OR values of acute radiation esophagitis in patients with gene type GC and GG were 0.654 and 0.627, respectively (P < 0.05), indicating that they had a low risk. The negative effect rates in patients with gene type GG, CG and CC were 7.69 % (8/104), 19.40 % (13/67) and 41.18 % (35/85), respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the clinical prognosis among these genotypes (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Gene type CC at miRNA-146a polymorphic site rs2910164 can increase the risk of acute radiation esophagitis and decrease the clinical prognosis in patients with esophageal neoplasms.

METHODS: The genotype of TGF-β1-509C/T was detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP) in 230 ESCC patients receiving radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the polymorphism and radiochemotherapy response. The associations between overall survival time or hazard ratio (HR) of ESCC patients and genetic variation or the clinical data were estimated by applying univariate and multivariate Cox-regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 208 patients with upper gastrointestinal contrast assessment, 87 cases were susceptible to radiochemotherapy treatment and the TGF-β1-509CC, CT and TT genotype patients were 17 (19.5%), 48 (55.2%) and 22 (25.3%), respectively. Among the patients who were insensitive to radiochemotherapy treatment (n = 121), the TGF-β1-509CC, CT and TT genotype patients were 39 (32.2%), 54 (44.6%) and 28 (23.2%), respectively. Compared with TGF-β1-509CC genotype, the CT and TT genotype carriers had a significantly better treatment response (adjusted OR = 2.07, 95%CI, 1.05 - 4.09, P = 0.036). The median survival time of CC genotype patients was 17.0 (95%CI, 12.0 - 23.0) months, CT genotype patients was 22.0 (95%CI, 16.0 - 33.0) months and TT genotype patients was 25.0 (95%CI, 15.0 - 41.0) months. Compared to CC genotype patients, the survival time difference of CT and TT group was close to the statistical break point (P = 0.063). Our data showed that the subjects with CT or TT genotype had an decreased HR respectively as compared with those with CC genotype (CT, adjusted HR = 0.81, 95%CI, 0.52 - 1.24; TT, adjusted HR = 0.86, 95%CI, 0.65 - 1.12), but the difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, tumor location, clinical stage and radiochemotherapy response affected the overall survival time of the patient significantly (adjusted HR = 1.28, 95%CI: 1.01 - 1.61, P = 0.040; 1.49, 95%CI, 1.17 - 1.88, P = 0.001; 1.55, 95%CI, 1.06 - 2.26, P = 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that TGF-β1-509C/T polymorphisms were associated with radiochemotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma which might be genetic markers for prediction of the radiochemotherapy response in ESCC patients.

178	Prediction of response to chemoradiation in rectal cancer by a gene polymorphism in the epidermal growth factor receptor promoter region	English	2006	16757132	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16757132	Journal Article	\N	74	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Preoperative radiation was given as an external total tumor dose of 60 Gy combined with an intracavitary boost of a 5 Gy single fraction to the tumor bed. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of oral Uftoral 300/mg/㎡ daily and leucovorin 22.5 mg/daily 5 days a week. The operation was performed 8 weeks posttreatment.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been associated with radioresistance in solid tumors. Recently a polymorphism in the Sp1 recognition site of the EGFR promoter region was identified. The present study investigated the predictive value of this polymorphism for the outcome of chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The study included 77 patients with locally advanced T3 rectal tumors. Treatment consisted of preoperative radiation therapy at a total tumor dose of 65 Gy and concomitant chemotherapy with Uftoral. Blood samples from 63 patients were evaluated for Sp1 -216 G/T polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Forty-eight primary tumor biopsies were available for EGFR immunostaining. Patients underwent surgery 8 weeks after treatment. Pathologic response evaluation was performed according to the tumor regression grade (TRG) system. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent had major response (TRG1-2) and 51% moderate response (TRG 3-4) to chemoradiation. The rates of major response were 34% (10/29) in GG homozygote patients compared with 65% (22/34) in patients with T containing variants (p=0.023). Fifty-eight percent of biopsies were positive for EGFR expression (28/48). The major response rates with regard to EGFR immunostaining were not significantly different. EGFR-positive tumors were found in 83% of the GG homozygote patients compared with 38% of patients with TT or GT variants (p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant correlation between EGFR Sp1 -216 G/T polymorphism and treatment response to chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer. Further investigations of a second set of patient and other treatment schedules are warranted.

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: To investigate whether transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta1) single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility of breast cancer patients to severe radiation-induced normal tissue damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PCR-RFLP assays were performed for TGFbeta1 gene polymorphisms on DNA obtained from 103 breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy. The G-800A, C-509T, T+869C and G+915C polymorphic sites were examined, and genotype and allele frequencies of two subgroups of patients were calculated and compared. RESULTS: The less prevalent -509T and +869C alleles were significantly associated with a subgroup of patients who developed severe radiation-induced normal tissue fibrosis (n=15) when compared with those who did not (n=88) (odds ratio=3.4, p=0.0036, and 2.37, p=0.035, respectively). Furthermore, patients with the -509TT or +869CC genotypes were between seven and 15 times more likely to develop severe fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings imply a role for the -509T and +869C alleles in the pathobiological mechanisms underlying susceptibility to radiation-induced fibrosis. Their predictive value would be limited to patients who are -509TT or +869CC, but if "fibrosis-associated" polymorphic sites in other genes could be identified, it may be possible to detect fibrosis prone individuals before radiotherapy with greater certainty.

Hormone therapy was used in 49 patients.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	The objective of this study was to determine whether an association exists between certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been linked with adverse normal tissue effects resulting from radiotherapy, and the development of radiation injury resulting from radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A total of 135 consecutive patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and a minimum of 1 year of follow-up who had been treated with radiation therapy, either brachytherapy alone or in combination with external-beam radiotherapy, with or without hormone therapy, were genotyped for SNPs in SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3. Three common late tissue toxicities were investigated: late rectal bleeding, urinary morbidity, and erectile dysfunction. Patients with the XRCC1 rs25489 G/A (Arg280His) genotype were more likely to develop erectile dysfunction after irradiation than patients who had the G/G genotype (67% compared to 24%; P=0.048). In addition, patients who had the SOD2 rs4880 T/C (Val16Ala) genotype exhibited a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients who had either the C/C or T/T genotype for this SNP (8% compared to 0%; P=0.02). Finally, patients with the combination of the SOD2 rs4880 C/T genotype and XRCC3 rs861539 T/C (Thr241Met) genotype experienced a significant increase in grade 2 late rectal bleeding compared to patients without this particular genotypic arrangement (14% compared to 1%; P=0.002). These results suggest that SNPs in the SOD2, XRCC1 and XRCC3 genes are associated with the development of late radiation injury in patients treated with radiation therapy for prostate adenocarcinoma.

During radiation, patients received 5-fluorouracil either as a 4-day infusion (1000 mg/㎡ ) at the beginning and end of radiation treatment or as a daily continuous infusion (200 mg/㎡ ).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	An association between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway and response of cancer cells to ionizing radiation has been reported. Recently, a polymorphic variant in the EGFR gene that leads to an arginine-to-lysine substitution in the extracellular domain at codon 497 within subdomain IV of EGFR has been identified. The variant EGFR (HER-1 497K) may lead to attenuation in ligand binding, growth stimulation, tyrosine kinase activation, and induction of proto-oncogenes myc, fos, and jun. A (CA)(n) repeat polymorphism in intron 1 of the EGFR gene that alters EGFR expression in vitro and in vivo has also been described. In the current pilot study, we assessed both polymorphisms in 59 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy using PCR-RFLP and a 5'-end [gamma-(33)P]ATP-labeled PCR protocol. We tested whether either polymorphism alone or in combination can be associated with local recurrence in the setting of chemoradiation treatment. We found that patients with HER-1 497 Arg/Arg genotype or lower number of CA repeats (both alleles <20) tended to have a higher risk of local recurrence (P = 0.24 and 0.31, respectively). Combined analysis showed the highest risk for local recurrence was seen in patients who possessed both a HER-1 497 Arg allele and <20 CA repeats (P = 0.05, log-rank test). Our data suggest that the HER-1 R497K and EGFR intron 1 (CA)(n) repeat polymorphisms may be potential indicators of radiosensitivity in patients with rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation.

182	Pharmacogenetic study in rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy: polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, epidermal growth factor receptor, GSTP1, and DNA repairgenes	English	2011	21570215	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570215	Journal Article	\N	128	31	97	\N	65	[32.0,83.0)	All patients included in the present study were treated preoperatively with radiotherapy (RT) and concomitant chemotherapy. RT consisted of megavoltage irradiation ( 60 Co or 18-MeV linear accel- erator) to the pelvis, with a total dose of 45 Gy within 5 weeks. The chemotherapeutic protocols were as follows: (1) 5-FU in a 5-day infusion (1,000 mg/㎡ ) at the beginning and end of RT; (2) a daily continuous infusion of 5-FU (225 mg/㎡ ) during the entire radiotherapy period; (3) capecitabine alone (825 mg/㎡ twice daily on each day of RT); (4) capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin 50 mg/㎡ weekly for 5 weeks; and (5) 5-FU (225 mg/㎡ ) during the entire RT period plus oxaliplatin 50 mg/㎡ weekly for 5 weeks. Resection surgery was performed in all patients 6–8 weeks after the preoperative treatment. Total mesorectal excision was performed for mid- or distal rectal tumors, and an anterior resection excision with partial mesorectal excision was used for proximal cases. Additional adjuvant treatment after surgery was left to the discretion of the treating physician: 76 patients (59%) received fluoropyrimidine-based adjuvant chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Several studies have been performed to evaluate the usefulness of neoadjuvant treatment using oxaliplatin and fluoropyrimidines for locally advanced rectal cancer. However, preoperative biomarkers of outcome are lacking. We studied the polymorphisms in thymidylate synthase, epidermal growth factor receptor, glutathione S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1), and several DNA repair genes to evaluate their usefulness as pharmacogenetic markers in a cohort of 128 rectal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood samples were obtained from 128 patients with Stage II-III rectal cancer. DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood nucleated cells, and the genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and automated sequencing techniques or using a 48.48 dynamic array on the BioMark system. The germline polymorphisms studied were thymidylate synthase, (VNTR/5'UTR, 2R G>C single nucleotide polymorphism [SNP], 3R G>C SNP), epidermal growth factor receptor (Arg497Lys), GSTP1 (Ile105val), excision repair cross-complementing 1 (Asn118Asn, 8092C>A, 19716G>C), X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) (Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln), and xeroderma pigmentosum group D (Lys751Gln). The pathologic response, pathologic regression, progression-free survival, and overall survival were evaluated according to each genotype. RESULTS: The ∗3/∗3 thymidylate synthase genotype was associated with a greater response rate (pathologic complete remission and microfoci residual tumor, 59% in ∗3/∗3 vs. 35% in ∗2/∗2 and ∗2/∗3; p=.013). For the thymidylate synthase genotype, the median progression-free survival was 103 months for the ∗3/∗3 patients and 84 months for the ∗2/∗2 and ∗2/∗3 patients (p=.039). For XRCC1 Arg399Gln SNP, the median progression-free survival was 101 months for the G/G, 78 months for the G/A, and 31 months for the A/A patients (p=.048). CONCLUSIONS: The thymidylate synthase genotype and XRCC1 Arg399Gln polymorphism might help to identify Stage II-III rectal cancer patients with a better outcome after preoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy.

183	Association of P53 and ATM Polymorphisms With Risk of Radiation-Induced Pneumonitis in Lung Cancer Patients Treated With Radiotherapy	English	2011	20729006	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20729006	Journal Article	\N	253	207	46	\N	\N	\N	All patients received radiotherapy with 6-MV X-rays from a linear accelerator (Varian 600CD, Palo Alto, CA). A total dose of 50–70 Gy was given with 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days a week. Among 253 patients, 206 received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (CRT), whereas 47 received two-dimensional CRT. Computed to- mography simulation (Somaton, Siemens, Berlin, Germany) was performed in 206 patients before the treatment was planned. After the images were transferred to a three-dimensional planning system (Pinnacle 3 Version 8.0d), the target volumes and critical normal organs were delineated. The lung volume receiving >20 Gy (V20) was limited to 25–30% according to individual general performance, pulmonary function, and treatment schedules.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) is the most common dose-limiting complication in lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Accumulating evidence indicates that P53 and the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM)-dependent signaling response cascade play a crucial role in radiation-induced diseases. Consistent with this, our previous study showed that a functional genetic ATM polymorphism was associated with increased RP risk. METHODS AND MATERIALS: To evaluate the role of genetic P53 polymorphism in RP, we analyzed the P53 Arg72Pro polymorphism in a cohort including 253 lung cancer patients receiving thoracic irradiation. RESULTS: We found that the P53 72Arg/Arg genotype was associated with increased RP risk compared with the 72Pro/Pro genotype. Furthermore, the P53 Arg72Pro and ATM -111G>A polymorphisms display an additive combination effect in intensifying the risk of developing RP. The cross-validation test showed that 63.2% of RP cases can be identified by P53 and ATM genotypes.

185	Genetic variants in inflammation-related genes are associated with radiation-induced toxicityfollowing treatment for non-small cell lung cancer	English	2010	20811626	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20811626	Journal Article	\N	173	91	82	\N	63.6000000000000014	\N	Patients were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy is often accompanied by the development of esophagitis and pneumonitis. Identifying patients who might be at increased risk for normal tissue toxicity would help in determination of the optimal radiation dose to avoid these events. We profiled 59 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 37 inflammation-related genes in 173 NSCLC patients with stage IIIA/IIIB (dry) disease who were treated with definitive radiation or chemoradiation. For esophagitis risk, nine SNPs were associated with a 1.5- to 4-fold increase in risk, including three PTGS2 (COX2) variants: rs20417 (HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.10-3.39), rs5275 (HR:1.58, 95% CI:1.09-2.27), and rs689470 (HR:3.38, 95% CI:1.09-10.49). Significantly increased risk of pneumonitis was observed for patients with genetic variation in the proinflammatory genes IL1A, IL8, TNF, TNFRSF1B, and MIF. In contrast, NOS3:rs1799983 displayed a protective effect with a 45% reduction in pneumonitis risk (HR:0.55, 95% CI:0.31-0.96). Pneumonitis risk was also modulated by polymorphisms in anti-inflammatory genes, including genetic variation in IL13. rs20541 and rs180925 each resulted in increased risk (HR:2.95, 95% CI:1.14-7.63 and HR:3.23, 95% CI:1.03-10.18, respectively). The cumulative effect of these SNPs on risk was dose-dependent, as evidenced by a significantly increased risk of either toxicity with an increasing number of risk genotypes (P<0.001). These results suggest that genetic variations among inflammation pathway genes may modulate the development of radiation-induced toxicity and, ultimately, help in identifying patients who are at an increased likelihood for such events.

186	TGFβ1 Polymorphisms Predict Distant Metastasis-Free Survival in Patients with Inoperable Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer after Definitive Radiotherapy	English	2013	23840350	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840350	Journal Article	Caucasian; Black; Other	205	114	91	64	\N	[35.0,83.0)	Patients treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: Transforming growth factor (TGF) -β1 signaling is involved in cancer-cell metastasis. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at TGFβ1 were associated with overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with definitive radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy. METHODS: We genotyped TGFβ1 SNPs at rs1800469 (C-509T), rs1800471 (G915C), and rs1982073 (T+29C) by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in blood samples from 205 NSCLC patients who had had definitive radiotherapy at one institution in November 1998-January 2005. We also tested whether the TGF-β1 rs1982073 (T+29C) SNP affected the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. RESULTS: Median follow-up time for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-97 months; 39 months for patients alive at the time of analysis). Multivariate analysis showed that the TGFβ1 rs1800469 CT/CC genotype was associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.463 [95% confidence interval {CI} = 1.012-2.114], P = 0.043) and shorter DMFS (HR = 1.601 [95% CI = 1.042-2.459], P = 0.032) and that the TGFβ1 rs1982073 CT/CC genotype predicted poor DMFS (HR = 1.589 [95% CI = 1.009-2.502], P = 0.046) and poor brain MFS (HR = 2.567 [95% CI = 1.155-5.702], P = 0.021) after adjustment for age, sex, race, performance status, smoking status, tumor histology and volume, stage, receipt of concurrent radiochemotherapy, number of chemotherapy cycles, and radiation dose. Transfection with TGFβ1+29C (vs. +29T) stimulated the migration and invasion of A549 and PC9 cells, suggesting that TGFβ1+29C may be linked with increased metastatic potential. CONCLUSIONS: TGFβ1 genotypes at rs1800469 and rs1982073 could be useful for predicting DMFS among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiation therapy. These findings require validation in larger prospective trials and thorough mechanistic studies.	Plos One	Stage I-II: 31 patients, Stage III: 174 patients.
187	Association between XRCC1 G399A Polymorphism and Late Complications to Radiotherapy in Saudi Head and Neck Cancer Patients	English	2008	20424661	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424661	Journal Article	Saudi	50	43	7	49	\N	[18.0,71.0)	The standardized radiation treatment was planned using CT-based (computerized tomography) 3D conformal technique and involved definitive RT with no surgery. Locally advanced stages also received neoadjuvant and concurrent chemotherapy consisting of cisplatinum and epirubicin. Total radiation doses were 66 or 70 Gy delivered using 2 Gy per fraction per day. The primary tumor site received the maximum dose using 6MV photon linear accelerator.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that patient to patient variation in normal tissue reactions to radiotherapy is associated with the presence of polymorphic variations in genes involved in DNA repair. PURPOSE: To test for a possible association between two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), XRCC1 399 G>A Arg/Gln and XRCC3 241 C>T Thr/Met and late reactions to radiotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case control study, 50 Head and Neck cancer patients were retrospectively recruited. The grade (G) of fibrosis, a late complication to radiotherapy, was scored using the RTOG/EORTC grading system. Radiosensitive patients with moderate to severe subcutaneous and deep tissue fibrosis (cases, G2-3, n=25) where matched with patients with minimal fibrotic reactions (control, G0-1, n=25). The two nonsynonymous SNPs were genotyped by direct sequencing of DNA extracted from blood or cultured fibroblasts. RESULTS: Allelic frequency showed significant association with grade of fibrosis for XRCC1 399 G/A (p=0.05), but not for XRCC3 241 C>T (p=0.10). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study corroborates the association between XRCC1 399 G>A and risk of late normal tissue complications following radiotherapy in our patients. Large studies are required to unravel more SNPs that can influence radiosensitivity and ascertain the associations with reactions to radiotherapy in order to be used as genetic predictive biomarkers of individual radiosensitivity.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: We investigated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) gene and the risk of radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RE) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-seven NSCLC patients with available genomic DNA samples and mostly treated with intensity modulated radio(chemo)therapy from 2003 to 2006 were used as a test dataset and 101 NSCLC patients treated with 3-dimensional conformal radio(chemo)therapy from 1998 to 2002 were used as a validation set. We genotyped three SNPs of the TGFβ1 gene (rs1800469:C-509T, rs1800471:G915C, and rs1982073:T869C) by the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: In the test dataset, the CT/TT genotypes of TGFβ1 rs1800469:C-509T were associated with a statistically significant higher risk of RE grade⩾3 in univariate (P=0.026) and multivariate analysis (P=0.045) when compared with the CC genotype. These results were again observed in both univariate (P=0.045) and multivariate (P=0.023) analysis in the validation dataset. CONCLUSION: We found and validated that the TGFβ1 rs1800469:C-509T genotype is associated with severe RE. This response marker may be used for guiding therapy intensity in an individual patient, which would further the goal of individualized therapy.

189	TGFB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with adverse quality of life in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy	English	2008	17689884	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17689884	Journal Article	White; African American; Hispanic; Other	141	141	\N	66	\N	[46.0,79.0)	All but 1 patient was treated with low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy using a real-time ultrasound-guided technique. One patient was treated with salvage external beam radiotherapy after a radical prostatectomy biochemical failure, and 1 patient was treated with a salvage partial 103 Pd implant 5 years after external beam radiotherapy. Treatment regimens evolved over time, thus there was overlap among different risk groups being treated by different regimens. The implant prescription dose was 160 Gy (Task Group Report 43) for 125 Iimplants, 124 Gy (National Institute of Standards and Technology Report 99) for full 103 Pd implants, and 100 Gy (National Institute of Standards and Technology Report 99) for partial 103 Pd implants. Generally, patients at higher risk for extracapsular extension on the basis of pretreatment risk factors underwent partial (67%) dose implantation followed by external beam radiation to 45 Gy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: To investigate whether the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within TGFB1 might be predictive for the development of adverse quality-of-life outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 141 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy were screened for SNPs in TGFB1 using DNA sequencing. Three quality-of-life outcomes were investigated: (1) prospective decline in erectile function, (2) urinary quality of life, and (3) rectal bleeding. Median follow-up was 51.3 months (range, 12-138 months; SD, 24.4 months). RESULTS: Those patients who possessed either the T/T genotype at position -509, the C/C genotype at position 869 (pro/pro, codon 10) or the G/C genotype at position 915 (arg/pro, codon 25) were significantly associated with the development of a decline in erectile function compared with those who did not have these genotypes: 56% (9 of 16) vs. 24% (11 of 45) (p = 0.02). In addition, patients with the -509 T/T genotype had a significantly increased risk of developing late rectal bleeding compared with those who had either the C/T or C/C genotype at this position: 55% (6 of 11) vs. 26% (34 of 130) (p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Possession of certain TGFB1 genotypes is associated with the development of both erectile dysfunction and late rectal bleeding in patients treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Therefore, identification of patients harboring these genotypes may represent a means to predict which men are most likely to suffer from poor quality-of-life outcomes after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

190	Association between TP53 and p21 genetic polymorphisms and acute side effects of radiotherapy in breast cancer patients	English	2006	16331344	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331344	Journal Article	\N	446	\N	446	60.2999999999999972	\N	\N	Study subjects included female breast cancer patients receiving primary RT of the breast after breast conserving surgery. All the patients were administered a typical breast-radiation treatment. The standard RT regime included irradiation of the whole breast at three RT departments, either 50 Gy given in 5?2.0 Gy fractions per week or 50.4 Gy in 5?1.8 Gy fractions per week followed by a boost. In the fourth RT department, 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation were applied in 5x2.0 Gy fractions per week without boost therapy. The biologically effective RT dose (BED) was calculated to account for differences in fractionation and overall treatment time. The average BED by censoring was 54.0±4.8 Gy with a range from 35.5 to 64.5 Gy	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	p53 and p21 play an important role in G1/S checkpoint control in response to ionizing radiation. Yet the genetic polymorphisms in these genes have not been investigated with respect to radiation toxicity in patients. We therefore assessed the association between TP53 Arg72Pro, p53PIN3 and p21 Ser31Arg polymorphisms and the risk of acute skin toxicity after radiotherapy in a prospective study of 446 female breast cancer patients (average age 60.3+/-9.0 years) receiving radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. The p53PIN3 polymorphism was determined by standard PCR, and TP53 Arg72Pro and p21 Ser31Arg polymorphisms using melting point analysis of sequence-specific hybridization probes. The development of acute skin toxicity (moist desquamation) was modelled using Cox proportional hazards, accounting for cumulative biologically effective radiation dose. Overall, the development of acute skin toxicity, which presented in 77 patients, was not significantly associated with the polymorphisms studied. Risks were however differential by body mass index. Compared to non-carriers, TP53 72Pro carriers had a non-significantly decreased risk of acute skin toxicity in normal weight women (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI, 0.18-1.18) but not in overweight patients (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% CI, 0.61-1.89) (p(interaction) =0.14). Haplotype analysis for the TP53 polymorphisms suggested that effect modification by TP53 72Pro may differ according to the p53PIN3 allele (p(interaction)=0.06). Furthermore, in TP53 72Pro carriers with p21 Ser/Ser genotype, the occurrence of acute toxicity was reduced in normal weight but not overweight patients. In conclusion, the TP53 72Pro variant may be associated with the development of acute skin toxicity after radiotherapy in patients with normal weight. Large clinical studies are needed to clearly confirm this association.	Breast Cancer Research and Treatment	\N
191	Possession of ATM sequence variants as predictor for late normal tissue responses in breast cancer patients treated with radiotherapy	English	2007	17517479	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17517479	Journal Article	\N	131	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Patients underwent breast conservation surgery and adjuvant RT between 1987 and 2004 at three tertiary referral centers. The RT was delivered with 6-MV phtons using either opposed tangential portals alone or three fields, including an additional supraclavicular portal if more than four axillary lymph nodes were involved. The whole breast doses ranged from 45 to 50.4Gy. Inaddition, 82% of patients received an electron boost to the surgical bed designed to bring the dose to the tumor bed to ≥60 Gy. The electron energy used was typically 6–12 MeV and was prescribed to the 85% isodose line.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: The ATM gene product is a central component of cell cycle regulation and genomic surveillance. We hypothesized that DNA sequence alterations in ATM predict for adverse effects after external beam radiotherapy for early breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 131 patients with a minimum of 2 years follow-up who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy were screened for sequence alterations in ATM using DNA from blood lymphocytes. Genetic variants were identified using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group late morbidity scoring schemes for skin and subcutaneous tissues were applied to quantify the radiation-induced effects. RESULTS: Of the 131 patients, 51 possessed ATM sequence alterations located within exons or in short intron regions flanking each exon that encompass putative splice site regions. Of these 51 patients, 21 (41%) exhibited a minimum of a Grade 2 late radiation response. In contrast, of the 80 patients without an ATM sequence variation, only 18 (23%) had radiation-induced adverse responses, for an odds ratio of 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-5.2). Fifteen patients were heterozygous for the G-->A polymorphism at nucleotide 5557, which causes substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at position 1853 of the ATM protein. Of these 15 patients, 8 (53%) exhibited a Grade 2-4 late response compared with 31 (27%) of the 116 patients without this alteration, for an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-9.4). CONCLUSION: Sequence variants located in the ATM gene, in particular the 5557 G-->A polymorphism, may predict for late adverse radiation responses in breast cancer patients.

Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: To identify haplotypes of single nucleotide polymorphism markers associated with the risk of early adverse skin reactions (EASRs) after radiotherapy in breast cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: DNA was sampled from 399 Japanese breast cancer patients who qualified for breast-conserving radiotherapy. Using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria scoring system, version 2, the patients were grouped according to EASRs, defined as those occurring within 3 months of starting radiotherapy (Grade 1 or less, n = 290; Grade 2 or greater, n = 109). A total of 999 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 137 candidate genes for radiation susceptibility were genotyped, and the haplotype associations between groups were assessed. RESULTS: The global haplotype association analysis (p < 0.05 and false discovery rate < 0.05) indicated that estimated haplotypes in six loci were associated with EASR risk. A comparison of the risk haplotype with the most frequent haplotype in each locus showed haplotype GGTT in CD44 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-4.43) resulted in a significantly greater EASR risk. Five haplotypes, CG in MAD2L2 (OR = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87), GTTG in PTTG1 (OR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.96), TCC (OR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.89) and CCG (OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.92) in RAD9A, and GCT in LIG3 (OR = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.93) were associated with a reduced EASR risk. No significant risk haplotype was observed in REV3L. CONCLUSION: Individual radiosensitivity can be partly determined by these haplotypes in multiple loci. Our findings may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genetic variation in radiation sensitivity and resistance among breast cancer patients.

The dose fractionation schedule of 66.0 GyE was delivered in 20 fractions within 5 weeks. None of the patients had undergone previous treatment for PCa except for hormonal therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: To investigate the genetic risk of late urinary morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy in prostate cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 197 prostate cancer patients who had undergone carbon ion radiotherapy were evaluated for urinary morbidity. The distribution of patients with dysuria was as follows: Grade 0, 165; Grade 1, 28; and Grade 2, 4 patients. The patients were divided (2:1) consecutively into the training and test sets and then categorized into control (Grade 0) and case (Grade 1 or greater) groups. First, 450 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 118 candidate genes were genotyped in the training set. The associations between the SNP genotypes and urinary morbidity were assessed using Fisher's exact test. Then, various combinations of the markers were tested for their ability to maximize the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC-ROC) curve analysis results. Finally, the test set was validated for the selected markers. RESULTS: When the SNP markers in the SART1, ID3, EPDR1, PAH, and XRCC6 genes in the training set were subjected to AUC-ROC curve analysis, the AUC-ROC curve reached a maximum of 0.86. The AUC-ROC curve of these markers in the test set was 0.77. The SNPs in these five genes were defined as "risk genotypes." Approximately 90% of patients in the case group (Grade 1 or greater) had three or more risk genotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results have shown that patients with late urinary morbidity after carbon ion radiotherapy can be stratified according to the total number of risk genotypes they harbor.

In the first group, a consecutive boost of 50.4Gy/3 fractions to the tumour and mesorectum was given following the CTV dose of 45Gy/25 fractions, for a total dose of 50.4Gy. In the second group, a concomitant boost of 10Gy/10 fractions over 5 weeks, 2 times a week (1Gy/fraction, 6 hours interval between the two daily fractions), was delivered to the tumour and mesorectum during the CTV dose of 45Gy fractions, for a total dose of 55Gy. Fluoropyrimidines alone (5-FU 225mg/㎡/ day iv continuous infusion for 5 weeks or capecitabine 1650mg/㎡ in two daily oral administrations for 5 weeks) was prescribed with 50.4Gy or 55.0Gy, whereas the capecitabine (1300mg/㎡) was administered with oxaliplatin (130mg/㎡ every 19 days) and concurrently standards RT dose of 50.4Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	In rectal cancer, a pathologic complete response (pCR) to pre-operative treatment is a favourable prognostic marker, but is reported in a minority of the patients. We aimed at identifying microRNA-related host genetic polymorphisms predictive of pCR. A panel of 114 microRNA-related tagging polymorphisms was selected and analyzed on 265 locally advanced rectal cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. Patients were stratified in two subgroups according to the radiotherapy dose (50.4Gy for 202 patients, 55.0Gy for 78 patients). Interactions among genetic and clinical-pathological variants were investigated by recursive partitioning analysis. Only polymorphisms with a consistent significant effect in the two subgroups of patients were selected as predictive markers of pCR. The results were validated by bootstrap analysis. SMAD3-rs744910, SMAD3-rs745103, and TRBP-rs6088619 were associated to an increased chance of pCR (p=0.0153, p=0.0471, p=0.0125). DROSHA-rs10719 and SMAD3-rs17228212 had an opposite detrimental effect on pathological tumour response (p=0.0274, p=0.0049). Recursive partitioning analysis highlighted that a longer interval time between the end of radiotherapy and surgery increases the chance of pCR in patients with a specific combination of SMAD3-rs744910 and TRBP-rs6088619 genotypes. This study demonstrated that microRNA-related host genetic polymorphisms can predict pCR to neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy, and could be used to personalize the interval time between the end of radiotherapy and surgery.

Radiotherapy	5	X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) is required for single-strand break repair in human cells and several polymorphisms in this gene have been implicated in cancer risk and clinical prognostic factors. We examined the frequency of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) variant -77T-->C (rs 3213235) in 247 French breast cancer (BC) patients, 66 of whom were adverse radiotherapy responders, and 380 controls and determined the haplotypes based on this and the previously genotyped variants Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln. The -77T-->C variant alone showed no significant association with BC risk or therapeutic radiation sensitivity. The H5 haplotype (variant allele codon 280, wild-type allele other positions) was associated with increased BC risk [odds ratio (OR), 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12-3.23] and the H3 haplotype (wild-type allele all four positions) was inversely associated with therapeutic radiation sensitivity compared with the reference group (H1 haplotype, -77C, wild-type allele codons 194, 280, 399) (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.92). However given that the global tests for association were not significant these results should be interpreted carefully. Lymphoblastoid cell lines heterozygous for the H1/H3 haplotypes had a significantly higher cell survival (P=0.04) after exposure to ionising radiation (IR) than those with the H1/H1 haplotypes, in agreement with the association study. However no haplotype-specific differences in XRCC1 expression or cell cycle progression were noted in the 24 h following IR exposure. These results suggest that the -77T-->C genotype or another variant in linkage disequilibrium influences the cellular response to DNA damage, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be established.

This fractionation schedule was applied both as an adjuvant, post-operative treatment and administered to women who had RT after a loco-regional recurrence following breast cancer surgery some years prior to referral to the NRH. This RT schedule was expected to be more effective and at the same time less resource-consuming than the conventional fractionation pattern (2 Gy x25, 5 treatments per week; total dose 50 Gy). The typical post-mastectomy target fields covered the ipsilateral lymph node regions in the axilla, the fossa supraclavicularis and along the arteria mammaria interna. Depending on the extent of the operation and/or the expected risk of local recurrence, the thoracic wall was also irradiated. In parallel with treatment A, an alternative treatment regimen was used (2.5 Gy x20, 4 treatments per week for 5 weeks; treatment B). This schedule still met the requirements related to limited RT capacity but was more in line with the conventional fractionation pattern of 5 weekly treatments of 2 Gy for 5 weeks. Treatment B was to be applied mainly in patients with primarily inoperable breast cancer, who could potentially be rendered operable by RT. From 1975 to 1991, 617 women received treatment B against the chest wall, with or without radiation to the regional lymph nodes. Of these 617 women, 155 were still alive in 1997. One-hundred-and-nineteen of these patients agreed to be included in the evaluation study and the same assessments of damage were performed as for the treatment A group.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: The ATM protein is activated as a result of ionizing radiation, and genetic variants of the ATM gene may therefore affect the level of radiation-induced damage. Individuals heterozygous for ATM mutations have been reported to have an increased risk of malignancy, especially breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Norwegian breast cancer patients (272) treated with radiation (252 of which were evaluated for radiation-induced adverse side effects), 95 Norwegian women with no known history of cancer and 95 American breast cancer patients treated with radiation (44 of which developed ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence, IBTR) were screened for sequence variations in all exons of the ATM gene as well as known intronic variants by denaturating high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by sequencing to determine the nature of the variant. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 56 variants were identified in the three materials combined. A borderline significant association with breast cancer risk was found for the 1229 T>C (Val>Ala) substitution in exon 11 (P-value 0.055) between the Norwegian controls and breast cancer patients as well as a borderline significant difference in haplotype distribution (P-value 0.06). Adverse side effects, such as: development of costal fractures and telangiectasias, subcutaneous and lung fibrosis, pleural thickening and atrophy were evaluated in the Norwegian patients. Significant associations were found for several of the identified variants such as rs1800058 (Leu > Phe) where a decrease in minor allele frequency was found with increasing level of adverse side effects for the clinical end-points pleural thickening and lung fibrosis, thus giving a protective effect. Overall our results indicate a role for variation in the ATM gene both for risk of developing breast cancer, and in radiation induced adverse side effects. No association could be found between risk of developing ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence and any of the sequence variants found in the American patient material.	Radiation Oncology	\N
196	Variation in the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (SOD2) is not a major cause of radiotherapy complications in breast cancer patients 	English	2002	12063011	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12063011	Journal Article	\N	75	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Between January 1986 and June 1994, 915 patients attending the Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton and Gloucestershire Oncology Centre, Cheltenham were entered into a randomized trial comparing three radiotherapy fractionation regimens after breast preserving surgery for early stage operable breast cancer. The duration of whole-breast radiotherapy was 5 weeks in all arms, involving ﬁve treatments per fortnight for patients randomized to 13 fractionations (3.0 or 3.3 Gy per fraction) and ﬁve treatments per week for patients in the third arm (2.0 Gy per fraction). Patients were treated in the supine position and most were treated with 6-MV X-rays. An elec- tron boost to the tumour bed of 14 Gy to 90% isodose in seven daily fractions was given to all patients with tumours extending to margins of resection. Two hundred and eighty- two patients received 50 Gy in 25 fractions, 270 patients received 42.9 Gy in 13 fractions and 283 patients received 39 Gy in 13 fractions.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small proportions of patients receiving radiotherapy develop marked long-term radiation damage. It is thought that this is due, at least in part, to intrinsic differences in cellular radiosensitivity, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Reactive oxygen species are involved in cellular radiation damage, hence inter-individual differences in free radical detoxification may be related to radiosensitivity. Within mitochondria manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) provides a major defence against oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species. MnSOD has been linked to expression of malignant phenotype and apoptosis and polymorphic variation in the gene, SOD2 to risk of breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one breast cancer patients developing marked changes in breast appearance after radiotherapy and 39 patients who showed no clinically detectable reaction after radiotherapy were analyzed for germline sequence variation in SOD2. RESULTS: The Ala-9Val polymorphism was detected, but no other sequence variants were detected in SOD2. Both alleles of the Ala-9Val polymorphism were equally distributed between the two patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: Sequence variation in SOD2 is not the major cause of radiotherapy complications in women with breast cancer.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	\N
197	Polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress (CAT, MnSOD, MPO, and eNOS) and acute toxicities from radiation therapy following lumpectomy for breast cancer	English	2006	17145829	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17145829	Journal Article	Caucasian	446	\N	446	\N	60	[26.0,87.0)	We recruited Caucasian female breast cancer patients receiving primary radiotherapy of the breast after breast conserving surgery. All regimens included irradiation of the entire breast. At three units, women received either 50 Gy given in 5 x 2.0 Gy fractions weekly or 50.4 Gy in 5 x 1.8 Gy fractions weekly followed by a boost radiation from 6 to 25 Gy. At the fourth radiation department, 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation were applied in 5 x 2.0 Gy factions weekly without a boost. The average biologically effective radiotherapy dose by censoring was 54.0 F 4.8 Gy with a range of 35.5 to 64.5 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	PURPOSE: Because radiotherapy exerts cytotoxic effects via generation of massive oxidative stress, we hypothesized that catalase, manganese superoxide dismutase, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) genotypes might result in greater risk of radiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Cases (n = 446) were Caucasian women with breast cancer who received radiotherapy following lumpectomy. Genotypes were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight. The development of acute reactions (moist desquamation) associated with genotypes was modeled using the Cox proportional hazards model, accounting for cumulative biologically effective radiation dose. RESULTS: Genotypes associated with higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were not associated with risk of radiotoxicity. However, relationships between overweight/obesity [body mass index (BMI), >25] and radiotoxicity risk seemed to be modified by eNOS and MPO genotypes associated with higher generation of nitric oxide and ROS, respectively. Women with high BMI (>25) and eNOS GG genotypes were at more than a 6-fold increase in risk (hazard ratio, 6.39; 95% confidence interval, 2.53-16.15) compared with those with BMI <25, and for MPO, those with high BMI (>25) and GG genotypes also had greater risk of radiotoxicity (hazard ratio, 3.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-7.35) compared with those with BMI <25. Overweight/obesity was not a strong risk factor among women with other eNOS and MPO genotypes. Exploratory analysis using classification and regression trees indicated that total number of risk alleles contributed, in part, to acute toxicity outcomes among a subgroup of women. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between BMI and radiotoxicity risk may be most apparent among women with genotypes related to higher levels of oxidative stress. Regression trees may be useful in future studies to examine the contributions of multiple factors to individual susceptibility to adverse effects of cancer treatment.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N
198	Genetic predictors of acute toxicities related to radiation therapy following lumpectomy for breast cancer: a case-series study	English	2006	16848913	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16848913	Journal Article	\N	446	\N	446	\N	\N	\N	Women were eligible if they were receiving primary radiation therapy following breast conserving surgery and had not previously received chemotherapy. All patients received standard breast irradiation treatments, including computed tomography based planning, simulation, verification, and quality assurance, with conformal tangential irradiation with lateral and medial wedge fields. All regimens included irradiation of the entire breast. At three units, women received either 50 Gy given in five 2.0 Gy fractions per week or 50.4 Gy given in five 1.8 Gy fractions per week, followed by boost radiation from 6 to 25 Gy. At the fourth radiation department, 56 Gy of whole breast irradiation were applied in five 2.0 Gy fractions per week without a boost.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy + Surgery	5	INTRODUCTION: The cytotoxic effects of radiation therapy are mediated primarily through increased formation of hydroxyl radicals and reactive oxygen species, which can damage cells, proteins and DNA; the glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) function to protect against oxidative stress. We hypothesized that polymorphisms encoding reduced or absent activity in the GSTs might result in greater risk for radiation-associated toxicity. METHODS: Women receiving therapy in radiation units in Germany following lumpectomy for breast cancer (1998-2001) provided a blood sample and completed an epidemiological questionnaire (n = 446). Genotypes were determined using Sequonom MALDI-TOF (GSTA1, GSTP1) and Masscode (GSTM1, GSTT1). Biologically effective radiotherapy dose (BED) was calculated, accounting for differences in fractionation and overall treatment time. Side effects considered were grade 2c and above, as classified using the modified Common Toxicity Criteria. Predictors of toxicity were modelled using Cox regression models in relation to BED, with adjustment for treating clinic, photon field, beam energy and boost method, and potential confounding variables. RESULTS: Low activity GSTP1 genotypes were associated with a greater than twofold increase in risk for acute skin toxicities (adjusted hazard ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.04-4.99). No associations were noted for the other GST genotypes. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that GSTP1 plays an important role in protecting normal cells from damage associated with radiation therapy. Studies examining the effects of GSTP1 polymorphisms on toxicity, recurrence and survival will further inform individualized therapeutics based on genotypes.	Breast Cancer Research	\N
201	TGFbeta1 polymorphisms and late clinical radiosensitivity in patients treated for gynecologic tumors	English	2006	16798416	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16798416	Journal Article	\N	78	\N	78	\N	59	[24.0,80.0)	The patients with cancer of the cervix (n=35) or endometrium (n=43) were treated at the Ghent University Hospital with fractionated external beam RT to the pelvis (1 anterior and 2 lateral ﬁelds, 25-MV photons) followed by a brachytherapy boost. Eighteen patients received a tumor dose of 45 Gy (25 x 1.8 Gy), 33 patients received a tumor dose of 46 Gy (23 x 2 Gy), and 23 patients received a tumor dose of 50 Gy (25 x 2 Gy). Four patients received 46 Gy supplemented with a parametrial boost up to 60 Gy. Except for 2 patients, all patients were additionally treated by brachytherapy using either vaginal ovoids, Fletcher type applications, or perineal implants. All brachytherapy was performed using a pulsed dose rate technique with iridium-192. Total doses from brachytherapy ranged from 15 to 35 Gy (dose rate, 0.5 to 0.65 Gy/h) at 0.5 cm from the applicator surface for ovoids and perineal implants and to point A for the Fletcher type application. Twenty-one patients with cancer of the cervix received combined radiochemotherapy and were treated with 40 mg/㎡ cisplatinum per week during the period of the external RT. Sixty-one patients were operatively treated with a Wertheim-Meigs hysterectomy. Nine premenopausal patients received hor- mone replacement therapy (estrogen).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To investigate the association between six transforming growth factor beta1 gene (TGFbeta1) polymorphisms (-1.552delAGG, -800G>A, -509C>T, Leu10Pro, Arg25Pro, Thr263Ile) and the occurrence of late normal tissue reactions after gynecologic radiotherapy (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Seventy-eight women with cervical or endometrial cancer and 140 control individuals were included in the study. According to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0) scale, 25 patients showed late adverse RT reactions (CTC2+), of whom 11 had severe complications (CTC3+). Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), single base extension and genotyping assays were performed to examine the polymorphic sites in TGFbeta1. RESULTS: Homozygous variant -1.552delAGG, -509TT, and 10Pro genotypes were associated with the risk of developing late severe RT reactions. Triple (variant) homozygous patients had a 3.6 times increased risk to develop severe RT reactions (p=0.26). Neither the -800A allele, nor the 25Pro allele or the 263Ile allele were associated with clinical radiosensitivity. There was perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the -1.552delAGG and the -509C>T polymorphisms, and tight LD between the -1.552/-509 and the Leu10Pro polymorphisms. Haplotype analysis revealed two major haplotypes but could not distinguish radiosensitive from nonradiosensitive patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that homozygous variant TGFbeta1 -1.552delAGG, -509TT, and 10Pro genotypes may be associated with severe clinical radiosensitivity after gynecologic RT.

202	Genetic variation in normal tissue toxicity induced by ionizing radiation	English	2009	19022265	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19022265	Journal Article	\N	405	405	\N	\N	68	\N	Our own prospective studies on more than 400 breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery confirmed this observation. All patients were treated between 2001 and 2005 by 3-D conformal radiotherapy with a target dose of 61–72Gy.	Radiotherapy + Surgery	5	Radiotherapy is an important weapon in the treatment of cancer, but adverse reactions developing in the co-irradiated normal tissue can be a threat for patients. Early reactions might disturb the usual application schedule and limit the radiation dose. Late appearing and degenerative reactions might reduce or destroy normal tissue function. Genetic markers conferring the ability to identify hyper-sensitive patients in advance would considerably improve therapy. Association studies on genetic variation and occurrence of side effects should help to identify such markers. This survey includes published studies and novel data from our own laboratory. It illustrates the presence of candidate polymorphisms in genes involved in the cellular response to irradiation which could be used as predictive markers for radiosensitivity in breast or prostate cancer patients. For other tumor types such as head and neck cancers or brain tumors, the available data are much more limited. In any case, further validation of these markers is needed in large patient cohorts with systematically recorded data on side effects and patient characteristics. Genetic variation contributing to radiosensitivity should be screened on a broader basis using newly developed, more comprehensive approaches such as genome-wide association studies.

203	Inﬂuence of DNA repair gene polymorphisms on prognosis in inoperable non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy	English	2012	22511383	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22511383	Journal Article	Caucasian	250	163	87	62	\N	\N	Patients with stage I–II (10%) were inoperable due to comorbidities. All patients received an external beam radiotherapy with a total dose ?20 gray (Gy). Patients treated with curative intent with doses ?60 Gy (48%) had treatment 5 days per week with fraction doses of 1.8–2.0 Gy given over 6–7 weeks. Patients treated with palliative intent received 20 Gy in 4.0 Gy fractions or 30 Gy in 3.0 Gy fractions over 5–10 days. Linear accelerators with 6–20 MV were used and the three-dimensional treatment planning system was routinely applied. Chemotherapy (1–6 courses of platinum-based doublet) was given to 171 patients, either as an induction treatment before radiotherapy (71%), or as a part of palliative regimen (29%).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may modulate not only an individual DNA repair capacity, DNA damage levels and cancer risk but also clinical outcome after DNA damage-inducing anticancer therapy. In this study, we analyzed the association between the XPA -4G>A, XPD Asp312Asn, hOGG1 Ser326Cys, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC2 -4234G>C, XRCC3 -4541A>G and Thr241Met polymorphisms and prognosis in 250 inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with radiotherapy and platinum-based chemotherapy. In univariate model, the XPA-4A and XRCC1 399Gln alleles alone and in combination influenced survival only in stage III group. In multivariate analysis, the XPA-4 GA/AA was associated with poor survival (HR 1.55, p = 0.011 overall and HR 1.72, p = 0.008 in stage III). In chemoradiotherapy group, the XPA-4A carriers were at increased risk of death and progression (HR 1.73, p = 0.013 and HR 1.65, p = 0.016, respectively), especially in stage III (p = 0.008). Moreover, individuals with ≥ 2 XPA/XRCC1 adverse alleles showed a higher risk of death (HR 1.46, p = 0.036 overall; HR 1.85, p = 0.004 in stage III and HR 1.71, p = 0.022 in chemoradiotherapy group) and progression (HR 1.75, p = 0.011 overall and HR 1.93, p = 0.005 in stage III). The XPA-4 GA/AA genotype individually and together with the XRCC1 399Gln was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in our study. Thus, our findings indicate a prognostic potential of the XPA-4G>A in unresected NSCLC treated with radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. The results require validation in an independent population.

204	Polymorphisms in GSTM1 and XPD genes predict clinical outcome in advanced oral cancerpatients treated with postoperative radiotherapy	English	2012	22213390	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22213390	Journal Article	\N	187	141	46	48	\N	[18.0,80.0)	The patients were planned and treated using either an anterolateral wedge pair or parallel opposed portals with tissue compensators using conventional fractionation (2 Gy/fraction) on megavoltage equipment, typically telecobalt. The median dose of RT was 60 Gy (IQR: 56–60) and the median duration of RT was 43 d (IQR: 40–46). Only 12 of 187 patients (6.5%) received suboptimal RT doses (<50 Gy). Palliative chemotherapy was offered to selected patients in case of recurrence.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Polymorphisms in metabolic and DNA repair genes may alter protein function, consequently affecting patients' response to chemo/radiotherapy. We retrospectively assessed whether polymorphisms of glutathione-S-transferase genes GSTM1 (deletion), GSTT1 (deletion), GSTP1 (Ile105Val, rs1695), and DNA repair genes hOGG1 (Ser326Cys, rs1052133), XRCC1 (Arg194Trp, rs1799782, and Arg399Gln, rs25487), XPD (Asp312Asn, rs1799793, and Lys751Gln, rs13181) can predict clinical outcome in 187 oral squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the role of polymorphic genotypes on relapse-free (RFS) and disease-specific (DSS) survival. Deletion polymorphism of GSTM1 gene was significantly associated with DSS. The rs1799793 variant allele showed significant protection in both DSS and RFS. Significant increase in RFS but not in DSS was observed with polymorphic rs13181. The combined analysis of GSTM1 and XPD polymorphisms revealed favorable effect on survival. GSTM1 and XPD variant alleles, independently as well as in combination may serve as important predictors of clinical outcome in radiotherapy-treated OSCC patients.

205	Association between XRCC1 and ERCC1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and the efficacy of concurrent radiochemotherapy in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	English	2017	28356949	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28356949	Journal Article	\N	50	38	12	\N	\N	\N	All patients were subjected to intensity‑modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in X-ray repair cross-complementing 1-399 (XRCC1-399) or excision repair cross-complementation group 1-118 (ERCC1-118) and the short-term efficacy of radiochemotherapy, tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). TaqMan probe-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was conducted to examine the levels of XRCC1-399 and ERCC1-118 SNPs in the peripheral blood of 50 patients with pathologically confirmed ESCC. In addition, the associations between different genotypes and short-term therapeutic efficacy [the complete remission (CR) rate], tumor metastasis and relapse, as well as the survival time following concurrent radiochemotherapy, were determined. A total of 50 ESCC patients who received concurrent radiochemotherapy were enrolled. It was found that the short-term therapeutic efficacy (CR rate) was higher in the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A/A genotype) than in the group of patients without the XRCC1-399 mutation (G/G genotype). In addition, the CR rate was significantly increased in patients carrying one or two ERCC1-118 C alleles (C/C or C/T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T/T genotype). The differences were statistically significant (A/A vs. G/G, P=0.014; TT vs. C/T+C/C, P=0.040). During the follow-up period, the group of patients carrying the homozygous mutation of XRCC1-399 (A/A genotype) exhibited a markedly reduced risk of metastasis and relapse compared with the group of patients carrying non-mutated XRCC1-399 (G/G genotype; P=0.031). By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was not associated with the risk of metastasis and recurrence (P>0.05). The combined results of univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the SNP in ERCC1-118 was closely associated with survival time. The mean survival time was significantly prolonged in patients carrying 1 or 2 C alleles (C/C or C/T genotype) compared with patients lacking the C allele (T/T genotype) [T/T vs. C/C, HR=12.96, 95% confidence interval (CI)=3.08-54.61, P<0.001; TT vs. C/T+C/C, HR=11.71, 95% CI=3.06-44.83, P<0.001]. However, XRCC1-399SNP had no effect on survival time (P>0.05). XRCCl-399 SNP was associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and tumor metastasis/relapse in ESCC patients who received the docetaxel plus cisplatin (TP) regimen-based concurrent radiochemotherapy. By contrast, ERCC1-118 SNP was significantly associated with the short-term therapeutic efficacy (the CR rate) and survival time in ESCC patients who received TP regimen-based concurrent radiochemotherapy.

206	Single Nucleotide Polymorphism TGFβ1 R25P Correlates with Acute Toxicity during Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer Patients	English	2017	28333014	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28333014	Journal Article	Caucasian; Black; Asian	165	102	63	55	\N	[24.0,89.0)	The recommended treatment consisted of long-course pelvic external beam RT with concurrent infusional 5-FU (225 mg/㎡ , 5 days/week) or capecitabine (825 mg/㎡ , twice daily, 5 days per week). The use of 5-FU vs. capecitabine was decided by the treating medical oncologist, who considered multiple factors, including patient reliability. RT was provided with a conventional 3-field technique or with intensity modulated RT (IMRT), according to institutional practice. The decision of whether to use a 3-field approach or IMRT was made by the treating radiation oncologist, taking into account patient anatomy and body habitus. Beginning in 2007, IMRT planning was used for patients with low-lying rectal tumors, or those with a history of prior pelvic surgery resulting in a larger volume of small bowel in the pelvis. By 2011, the majority of patients were treated using IMRT to minimize dose to the normal tissues. The 3-field approach used posterior-anterior (PA) and opposed lateral fields to treat the whole pelvis to 45 Gy, followed by a 5.4 Gy boost to the rectal tumor, to give a total dose of 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction. With IMRT, the pelvis was treated to 45 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction and the rectal tumor to 50 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction, using an integrated boost. Contouring was performed according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group consensus guidelines. Patients were treated in the prone position. An Aquaplast mold was used for immobilization. Some patients were also treated with a full bladder, to minimize the amount of small bowel in the field.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: To validate the finding of an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and toxicity during chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in rectal cancer patients, in an independent population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The cohort consisted of 165 patients who received CRT for rectal cancer from 2006 to 2012. Prospectively recorded toxicity information, graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0, was retrieved from the medical record. Additionally, a subset of 52 patients recorded their gastrointestinal symptoms weekly during CRT, using the 7-item Bowel Problems Scale. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from normal tissue in the proctectomy specimens and screened for 3 SNPs: XRCC1 R399Q, XPD K751Q, and TGFβ1 R25P. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed. RESULTS: The median radiation dose was 50.4 Gy, and all patients received concurrent chemotherapy. Toxicities measured by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events were closely associated with patient-reported outcomes for the patients who completed the 7-item Bowel Problems Scale. Grade ≥3 toxicity occurred during CRT in 14 patients (8%). All 14 patients had either XRCC1 R399Q or TGFβ1 R25P polymorphisms. The TGFβ1 R25P polymorphism was significantly associated with grade ≥3 toxicity (odds ratio [OR] 3.47, P=.04) and, in patients who completed the Bowel Problems Scale, with grade ≥4 toxicity (OR 5.61, P=.02). The latter finding persisted in a multivariable logistic regression model controlling for ethnicity, age, and sex (adjusted OR 1.83, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: We have validated the correlation between the TGFβ1 R25P SNP and acute toxicity during CRT in an independent cohort using both clinician- and patient-reported toxicity. The information from our study could be used as a basis to formulate a prospective trial testing the utility of this SNP as a biomarker of acute toxicity during neoadjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer.

In total, 96% of patients received chemotherapy, including as induction prior to RT (8%), concurrentlywithRT(89%),andforconsolidationafterRT (57%). Notably, 12% of patients received consolidation docetaxel. All patients were treated with IMRT (75%) or 3D-CRT (25%). The median prescribed dose was 63 Gy (range, 41.4-72.7 Gy). Dosimetric parameters for the lungs included a median V20 of 34% (range, 9.4%-70%), V5 of 51% (range, 14%-93%), and MLD of 18.1 Gy (range, 6.1-32.4Gy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes from oxidative stress pathways and risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients treated with thoracic radiation therapy for locally advanced lung cancer. METHODS: A review was conducted of 136 patients treated with radiation therapy for lung cancer between 2001 and 2007, and who had prior genotyping of functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes including superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; rs4880) and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; rs1801131, rs1801133). RP events were retrospectively scored using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to identify clinical variables and genotypes associated with risk of RP of grades ≥2 and ≥3 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. P values were corrected for multiple hypothesis esting. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 21.4 months, the incidence of grade ≥2 RP was 29% and grade ≥3 RP was 14%. On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for clinical factors such as concurrent chemotherapy and consolidation docetaxel, and lung dosimetric parameters such as volume receiving greater than 20 Gy and mean lung dose, MTHFR genotype (rs1801131; AA versus AC/CC) was significantly associated with risk of grade ≥2 RP (hazard ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.76; P = .006, corrected P = .018) and grade ≥3 RP (hazard ratio: 0.21; 95% confidence interval: 0.06-0.70; P = .01; corrected P = .03).

209	VEGF G-1154A is predictive of severe acute toxicities during chemoradiotherapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese patients	English	2008	18641541	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18641541	Journal Article	Japanese	49	45	4	\N	64	[48.0,83.0)	One course of treatment consisted of protracted venous infusions of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/24 hr for day 1–5 and 8–12) and cisplatin (40 mg/㎡/3 hr on days 1 and 8) and radiation (2 Gy/day on day 1– 5, 8–12, and 15–19), and a second course (day 36–56) was repeated after a 2 week interval. 3–5 After another 2 week interval, the patients with locally advanced ESCC who showed an objective response to treatment received additional chemo- therapy with protracted venous infusions of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/24 hr for day 71–75 and 78–82) and cisplatin (40 mg/㎡/3 hr on day 71 and 78). If disease progression/ recurrence was observed, either salvage surgery, endoscopic treatment, or another regimen of chemotherapy was scheduled. In this study, salvage surgery or endoscopic treatment was conducted for 5 and 2 of the 49 patients, respectively. Filgrastim was administered if the patient had a neutrophil count of less than 1000/mm³ with fever, or 500/mm³, and the administration was repeated until the count was 5000/mm³. Thirty of 49 patients received a daily dose of 75 mg for 6.4 6 4.9 (range, 2–25) days. All patients received total parenteral nutrition before CRT, and nutritional support was continued if possible.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	This study was conducted to evaluate the association between systemic exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and genetic polymorphisms of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with clinical outcomes to a 5-FU/cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy in Japanese patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Forty-nine patients with ESCC (I/II/III/IVa = 11/9/17/7, with 5 postoperative recurrences) were enrolled into this study. One course of treatment consisted of protracted venous infusions of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/24 hr for day 1-5 and 8-12) and cisplatin (40 mg/m2/3 hr on day 1 and 8), and radiation (2 Gy/day on day 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19); a second course was repeated after a 2 week interval. A total of eight measurements of the plasma concentration of 5-FU were made per patient to evaluate its systemic exposure as area under the concentration time curve for 480 hours (AUC480h), and VEGF genotypes of T-1498C, G-1154A, C-634G, C-7T, C936T, and G1612A were evaluated. The mean value of AUC480h in the patients with a complete response was 58.7 +/- 16.8 mg*h/L, which was higher than that in the others, 49.0 +/- 10.9 mg*h/L (P = 0.029), whereas no such association was found for severe acute toxicities. VEGF genotype was not associated with the clinical response, whereas VEGF G-1154A resulted in severe acute leukopenia (P = 0.042) and severe acute cheilitis (P = 0.025). In conclusion, VEGF G-1154A was a predictor of severe acute toxicities during 5-FU/cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy in Japanese ESCC patients, whereas the AUC480h value of 5-FU was predictive of the clinical response.

210	Polymorphisms of the vascular endothelial growth factor gene and severe radiation pneumonitis in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with deﬁnitive radiotherapy	English	2011	22320189	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22320189	Journal Article	White; Black; Other	195	112	83	63	\N	[35.0,88.0)	The median total radiation dose was 63 Gy (range, 50.4–84.0 Gy) given between 1.2 and 2.0 Gy/fraction. Of the 195 patients, 20 received radiation only and 175 received radiation in combination with chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a major mediator of angiogenesis and lung cancer progression. We hypothesized that VEGF polymorphisms may modulate the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. We genotyped three potentially functional VEGF single nucleotide polymorphisms (-460 T > C [rs833061], -634 G > C [rs2010963] and +936 C > T [rs3025039]) and estimated the associations of their genotypes and haplotypes with severe radiation pneumonitis (RP ≥grade 3) in 195 NSCLC patients. We found that the VEGF genotypes of rs2010963 and rs3025039 single nucleotide polymorphisms as well as the -460C/-634G/+936C haplotype were predictors of RP development (adjusted hazard ratio [adjHR] = 2.33, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-5.37, P = 0.047 for CC vs GG genotypes; adjHR = 28.13, 95% CI, 5.24-151.02, P < 0.001 for TT vs CC genotypes; and adjHR = 2.51, 95% CI, 1.27-4.98, P = 0.008 for T-C-T vs C-G-C haplotypes). In addition, there was a trend towards reduced RP risk in patients carrying an increased number of protective VEGF genotypes. Our data suggest that VEGF polymorphisms can modulate the risk of radiation pneumonitis in NSCLC patients treated with definitive radiotherapy. Large and independent studies are needed to confirm our findings.	Cancer Science	Stage I-II: 29 patients, Stage III-IV: 166 patients.
253	Pharmacogenetics Biomarkers and Their Specific Role in Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Treatments: An Exploratory Study on Rectal Cancer Patients	English	2016	27608007	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27608007	Journal Article	\N	280	191	89	62	61	[20.0,82.0)	Two different RT programs were performed, according to clinical trials ongoing in the considered period time. Speciﬁcally, in the first RT program patients were treated with a standard dose of 50.4 Gy/28 fractions: a consecutive boost of 50.4 Gy/3 fractions to the tumor and mesorectum was given following the CTV dose of 45.0 Gy/25 fractions, for a total dose of 50.4 Gy. In the second program, patients underwent a dose of 55.0 Gy/25 fractions: speciﬁcally, a concomitant boost of 10 Gy/10 fractions over 5 weeks, 2 times a week (1 Gy/fraction, 6 h interval between the two daily fractions), was delivered to the tumor and mesorectum during the CTV dose of 45 Gy fractions, for a total dose of 55 Gy. Fluoropyrimidines alone (5-FU 225 mg/㎡/day intravenous continuous infusion for 5 weeks or capecitabine 1650 mg/㎡ in two daily oral administrations for 5 weeks) was prescribed with 50.4 Gy or 55.0 Gy, whereas the capecitabine (1300 mg/㎡ ) was administered with oxaliplatin (130 mg/㎡ every 19 days) and concurrently standards RT dose of 50.4 Gy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is still ascribed to a minority of patients. A pathway based-approach could highlight the predictive role of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The primary aim of this study was to define new predictive biomarkers considering treatment specificities. Secondary aim was to determine new potential predictive biomarkers independent from radiotherapy (RT) dosage and cotreatment with oxaliplatin. METHODS: Thirty germ-line SNPs in twenty-one genes were selected according to a pathway-based approach. Genetic analyses were performed on 280 LARC patients who underwent fluoropyrimidine-based CRT. The potential predictive role of these SNPs in determining pathological tumor response was tested in Group 1 (94 patients undergoing also oxaliplatin), Group 2 (73 patients treated with high RT dosage), Group 3 (113 patients treated with standard RT dosage), and in the pooled population (280 patients). RESULTS: Nine new predictive biomarkers were identified in the three groups. The most promising one was rs3136228-MSH6 (p = 0.004) arising from Group 3. In the pooled population, rs1801133-MTHFR showed only a trend (p = 0.073). CONCLUSION: This exploratory study highlighted new potential predictive biomarkers of neoadjuvant CRT and underlined the importance to strictly define treatment peculiarities in pharmacogenetic analyses.

211	Association of genetic variants in apoptosis genes FAS and FASL with radiation-induced late toxicity after prostate cancer radiotherapy	English	2014	24424626	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24424626	Journal Article	\N	607	607	\N	\N	\N	\N	Eligible participants received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy with high-energy photons (18 MV) to a median total dose of 70 Gy (range, 66–74 Gy) delivered in 1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction between January 2004 and January 2007.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Fas ligand (FASL) triggers apoptotic cell death by cross-linking with its receptor FAS, and after irradiation, expression of FAS and FASL is increased. In the present study, we investigated the association between common polymorphisms in the genes for FAS and FASL and the risk of late side effects after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The role of FAS (- 1377G > A, rs2234767 and - 670A > G, rs1800682) and FASL (- 844C > T, rs763110) gene polymorphisms in the development of high-grade late rectal and/or urinary toxicity (defined as late toxicity EORTC/RTOG grade ≥ 2) was analyzed in 607 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. DNA was isolated and the selected polymorphisms were determined by 5'-nuclease (TaqMan) assays. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 82 months, high-grade late rectal and/or urinary toxicity was observed in 175 patients (29.7 %). Univariate analysis revealed a significantly decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity in carriers of the FASL - 844T allele. After adjusting for covariates, patients harboring at least one - 844T allele (CT or TT genotype) remained at decreased risk of high-grade late toxicity compared with patients harboring the CC genotype [hazard ratio (HR) 0.585, 95 %CI 0.39-0.878; p = 0.010]. For patients with the - 844TT genotype, the HR was 0.404 (95 %CI 0.171-0.956; p = 0.039) in multivariate analysis. No significant associations were found for the remaining polymorphisms analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first evidence that the presence of the FASL - 844T variant allele may have a protective effect against the development of high-grade late rectal and/or urinary side effects after prostate cancer radiotherapy.

Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: This study sought to associate polymorphisms in genes related to cell cycle regulation or genome maintenance with radiotherapy (RT)-induced an early adverse reaction (EAR) in patients with cervical cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This study enrolled 243 cervical cancer patients who were treated with pelvic RT. An early gastrointestinal reaction was graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 2. Clinical factors of the enrolled patients were analyzed, and 208 patients were grouped for genetic analysis according to their EAR (Grade ≤1, n = 150; Grade ≥2, n = 58). Genomic DNA was genotyped, and association with the risk of EAR for 44 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 19 candidate genes was assessed by single-locus, haplotype, and multilocus analyses. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed two haplotypes to be associated with an increased risk of EAR. The first, comprising rs625120C, rs189037T, rs228589A, and rs183460G, is located between the 5' ends of NPAT and ATM (OR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.21-2.87), whereas the second is located in the AURKA gene and comprises rs2273535A and rs1047972G (OR = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.10-2.78). A third haplotype, rs2273535T and rs1047972A in AURKA, was associated with a reduced EAR risk (OR = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.89). The risk of EAR was significantly higher among patients with both risk diplotypes than in those possessing the other diplotypes (OR = 3.24; 95% CI, 1.52-6.92). CONCLUSIONS: Individual radiosensitivity of intestine may be determined by haplotypes in the NPAT-ATM and AURKA genes. These variants should be explored in larger association studies in cervical cancer patients.

The median total radiation dose was 54 Gy (range, 45 to 66 Gy), with 1.5 to 2 Gy administered per radiation treatment. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was administered to 62.1 % of patients (n=162).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	The αvβ6 integrin is a cell surface adhesion molecule that plays critical roles in the injury and inflammation processes. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in αvβ6 integrin genes (ITGAV and ITGB6) might be associated with the risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP) in lung cancer patients treated with thoracic radiation. We genotyped three potentially functional αvβ6 integrin single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1839123 and rs4129787 in ITGAV, and rs4665162 in ITGB6) and found that the genotypes of rs4665162 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were predictors of RP development (for grade ≥2 RP, HR = 1.505, 95 % CI 1.069-2.119, P = 0.019; for grade ≥3 RP, HR = 3.006, 95 % CI 1.431-6.313, P = 0.004). Our results showed that AG/GG genotypes of ITGB6 rs4665162 gene were associated with a higher risk of RP in patients with lung cancer receiving radiotherapy and thus may serve as a reliable predictor of RP.

Additionally, 78% (n = 94) of patients received concurrent platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: We investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) gene and the risk of radiation-induced esophageal toxicity (RIET) in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental dataset comprised 120 NSCLC patients who were treated with radio(chemo)therapy between 2005 and 2009, when novel radiation techniques were implemented at MD Anderson. The validation dataset comprised 181 NSCLC patients treated between 1998 and 2004. We genotyped two SNPs of the HSPB1 gene (rs2868370 and rs2868371) by TaqMan assay. RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses of the experimental dataset showed that the CG/GG genotypes of HSPB1 rs2868371 were associated with significantly lower risk of grade ≥3 RIET than the CC genotype (univariate hazard ratio [HR] 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.10-0.91; P=0.033; multivariate HR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.97; P=0.045). This difference in risk was replicated in the validation cohort despite the different radiation techniques used during that period. CONCLUSIONS: The CG/GG genotypes of HSPB1 rs2868371 were associated with lower risk of RIET, compared with the CC genotype in patients with NSCLC treated with radio(chemo)therapy. This finding should be validated in large multi-institutional prospective trials.	Radiotherapy and Oncology	Experimental dataset: Stage I-II: 15 patients, Stage III-IV: 105 patients.

Codominant genotypic tests and haplotypic analyses were undertaken to evaluate the correlation between TGFβ1 SNPs rs1800469, rs1800470 and rs1800472 and radio-induced toxicity. RESULTS: Neither the SNPs nor the haplotypes were found to be associated with the risk of late toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to exclude up to a 2-fold increase in the risk of developing late gastrointestinal and genitourinary radio-induced toxicity due to the TGFβ1 SNPs rs1800469 and rs1800470, as well as the two most frequent TGFβ1 haplotypes.

Thus, we determined the associations between four FAS and FASLG promoter variants (FAS1377G>A, rs2234767; 670A>G, rs1800682; FASLG844T>C, rs763110 and 124A>G, rs5030772) and the risk of recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP). We evaluated the associations between FAS and FASLG genetic variants and the risk of recurrence in a cohort of 1,008 patients. The log-rank test and multivariate Cox models were used to evaluate the associations. Compared with patients with common homozygous genotypes of FAS670 and FASLG844 polymorphisms, patients with variant genotypes had lower disease-free survival rates (log-rank p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and an approximately threefold higher risk of SCCOP recurrence (HR, 3.2;95% CI, 2.2-4.6; and HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.2-4.4, respectively) after multivariate adjustment. Furthermore, among patients with HPV16-positive tumors, those with variant genotypes of these two polymorphisms had lower disease-free survival rates (log-rank, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively) and a higher recurrence risk than did patients with common homozygous genotypes (HR, 12.9; 95% CI, 3.8-43.6; and HR, 8.1; 95% CI, 3.6-18.6, respectively), whereas no significant associations were found for FAS1377 and FASLG124 polymorphisms. Our findings suggest that FAS670 and FASLG844 polymorphisms modulate the risk of recurrence of SCCOP, particularly in patients with HPV16-positive tumors.

218	Dual Specificity Phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) Polymorphism Predicts Prognosis of Inoperable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer after Chemoradiotherapy	English	2016	27156317	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27156317	Journal Article	\N	277	192	85	60	\N	[34.0,87.0)	277 had inoperable lesions and received chemoradiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) inactivates different target kinases to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Altered DUSP6 expressions or gene polymorphisms are associated with human cancer development including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). DNA topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) regulates chromosome condensation and chromatid separation, and altered TOP2A expressions are associated with drug resistance development. This study assessed DUSP6 and TOP2A single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with NSCLC patient survival. METHODS: This study included 152 surgically resected NSCLC patients and 277 chemoradiotherapy treated inoperable cases. DNA samples from each patient were genotyped for DUSP6 and TOP2A SNPs. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazard model were used to evaluate the association between these variants and NSCLC overall survival. RESULTS: DUSP6 rs2279574 A/A genotype was associated with significantly poor inoperable NSCLC patient overall survival (A/A vs. C/C, adjusted HR = 1.549, 95% CI = 1.019-2.355). Stratification analysis against clinical stage, histology, weight loss, and ECOG performance status revealed that the DUSP6 rs2279574 A/A variant homozygous genotype is associated with a decrease in survival of stage IV NSCLC patients compared to those with the C/C genotype (log-rank, p = 0.003). No association was found among histology, weight loss, and ECOG performance status. Moreover, there was no association of TOP2A SNPs between clinicopathological and survival data. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from the current study demonstrated that functional DUSP6 rs2279574 polymorphism was able to predict inoperable NSCLC patient survival after chemoradiotherapy.

During radiotherapy, 34 patients received combi- nation chemotherapy with cisplatin (25-30 mg/㎡ on day 1-3) and 5-FU (450-500 mg/㎡ on days 1-5) every 4 weeks for a total of 8 weeks.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a key mediator of single-strand break DNA repair. However, XRCC1 polymorphisms in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the prognostic value for radiotherapy sensitivity are still not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between radiotherapy sensitivity of ESCC and XRCC1 polymorphisms rs25487 and rs1799782. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 97 patients with ESCC and genomic DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform method. Genotyping was performed using SNaPshot Multiplex Kit. Associations between genotypes and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed with Pearson’s Chi-Square test. No significant association was observed between rs25487 or rs1799782 genotype and the age, gender, tumor differentiation, treatment and response of the patients. rs1799782 genotype was associated with tumor size (P=0.029). The patients who had one or both of rs25487 or rs1799782 mutant type showed better response to radiotherapy than patients with wild-type alleles (total effective rate, P=0.048). In conclusion, ECSS patients with one or both of rs25487 and rs1799782 mutation have better response to radiotherapy than patients with wild-type of both SNPs. XRCC1 polymorphisms rs25487 and rs1799782 may be used as prognostic biomarkers for ESCC.	International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Pathology	\N

METHODS: A retrospective study compared the number of variant alleles at -509 and codons 10 and 25 of the TGFβ1 locus in women followed up in two prospective clinical trials who developed either marked radiotherapy adverse effects or no adverse effects after matching on fractionation schedule, breast size, surgical deficit, chemotherapy and length of follow up. RESULTS: Median follow up in the two trials was 7.4 (maximum 15) years and 5.3 (maximum 5.3) years. 1237/1716 (72%) women with photographic assessments of radiotherapy adverse effects were alive and well, and 147/1237 (12%) potential cases with the most marked change in photographic change in breast appearance were matched to potential controls recording no change. In an unmatched analysis of 82 cases and 108 controls, no significant difference in the number of genetic variants was observed.

222	Sequence variant discovery in DNA repair genes from radiosensitive and radiotolerant prostate brachytherapy patients	English	2009	19638463	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19638463	Journal Article	\N	41	41	\N	\N	\N	\N	Forty-one prostate brachytherapy patients living in the Vancouver lower mainland region with minimum 3 years of follow-up (mean, 6.6 years) were selected for study from the BCCA Prostate Brachytherapy database, agreed to participate, and provided informed consent.	Radiotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The presence of intrinsic radiosensitivity within prostate cancer patients may be an important factor contributing to development of radiation toxicity. We investigated whether variants in genes responsible for detecting and repairing DNA damage independently contribute to toxicity following prostate brachytherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples of 41 prostate brachytherapy patients, 21 with high and 20 with low late toxicity scores. For each patient, 242 PCR amplicons were generated containing 173 exons of eight candidate genes: ATM, BRCA1, ERCC2, H2AFX, LIG4, MDC1, MRE11A, and RAD50. These amplicons were sequenced and all sequence variants were subjected to statistical analysis to identify those associated with late radiation toxicity. RESULTS: Across 41 patients, 239 sites differed from the human genome reference sequence; 170 of these corresponded to known polymorphisms. Sixty variants, 14 of them novel, affected protein coding regions and 43 of these were missense mutations. In our patient population, the high toxicity group was enriched for individuals with at least one LIG4 coding variant (P = 0.028). One synonymous variant in MDC1, rs28986317, was associated with increased radiosensitivity (P = 0.048). A missense variant in ATM, rs1800057, associated with increased prostate cancer risk, was found exclusively in two high toxicity patients but did not reach statistical significance for association with radiosensitivity (P = 0.488). CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed new germ-line sequence variants, indicating that existing sequence databases do not fully represent the full extent of sequence variation. Variants in three DNA repair genes were linked to increased radiosensitivity but require validation in larger populations.	Clinical Cancer Research	\N

The median radiation dose received by patients was 66 Gy (range, 50.0-87.5 Gy) with a median mean lung dose (MLD) of 19.0 Gy (range, 2.7-30.6 Gy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mediates detection and repair of DNA damage. We investigated associations between ATM polymorphisms and severe radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP). METHODS AND MATERIALS: We genotyped 3 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ATM (rs1801516 [D1853N/5557G>A], rs189037 [-111G>A] and rs228590) in 362 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who received definitive (chemo)radiation therapy. The cumulative severe RP probabilities by genotypes were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The associations between severe RP risk and genotypes were assessed by both logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard model with time to event considered. RESULTS: Of 362 patients (72.4% of non-Hispanic whites), 56 (15.5%) experienced grade ≥3 RP. Patients carrying ATM rs189037 AG/GG or rs228590 TT/CT genotypes or rs189037G/rs228590T/rs1801516G (G-T-G) haplotype had a lower risk of severe RP (rs189037: GG/AG vs AA, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-0.83, P=.009; rs228590: TT/CT vs CC, HR=0.57, 95% CI, 0.33-0.97, P=.036; haplotype: G-T-G vs A-C-G, HR=0.52, 95% CI, 0.35-0.79, P=.002). Such positive findings remained in non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSIONS: ATM polymorphisms may serve as biomarkers for susceptibility to severe RP in non-Hispanic whites.

225	Acute radiation-induced nocturia in prostate cancer patients is associated with pretreatment symptoms, radical prostatectomy, and genetic markers in the TGFβ1 gene	English	2013	22658438	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22658438	Journal Article	Caucasian	322	322	\N	66	\N	[29.0,82.0)	Two hundred twenty-two patients were treated with primary IMRT, and 100 patients were treated with postoperative IMRT after radical prostatectomy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: After radiation therapy for prostate cancer, approximately 50% of the patients experience acute genitourinary symptoms, mostly nocturia. This may be highly bothersome with a major impact on the patient's quality of life. In the past, nocturia is seldom reported as a single, physiologically distinct endpoint, and little is known about its etiology. It is assumed that in addition to dose-volume parameters and patient- and therapy-related factors, a genetic component contributes to the development of radiation-induced damage. In this study, we investigated the association among dosimetric, clinical, and TGFβ1 polymorphisms and the development of acute radiation-induced nocturia in prostate cancer patients. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Data were available for 322 prostate cancer patients treated with primary or postoperative intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Five genetic markers in the TGFβ1 gene (-800 G>A, -509 C>T, codon 10 T>C, codon 25 G>C, g.10780 T>G), and a high number of clinical and dosimetric parameters were considered. Toxicity was scored using an symptom scale developed in-house. RESULTS: Radical prostatectomy (P<.001) and the presence of pretreatment nocturia (P<.001) are significantly associated with the occurrence of radiation-induced acute toxicity. The -509 CT/TT (P=.010) and codon 10 TC/CC (P=.005) genotypes are significantly associated with an increased risk for radiation-induced acute nocturia. CONCLUSIONS: Radical prostatectomy, the presence of pretreatment nocturia symptoms, and the variant alleles of TGFβ1 -509 C>T and codon 10 T>C are identified as factors involved in the development of acute radiation-induced nocturia. These findings may contribute to the research on prediction of late nocturia after IMRT for prostate cancer.	International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics	\N
226	A haplotype of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene predicts poor tumor response in rectal cancer patients receiving preoperative chemoradiation	English	2006	17047490	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17047490	Journal Article	\N	125	80	45	60	\N	[31.0,79.0)	Patients underwent preoperative external beam RTusing high-energy photons (> 6 MV). The clinical target volume, according to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements guidelines, included primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (mesorectal, presacral, internal iliac vessels and obturator foramen). The four-beam ‘box technique’ was used, with the upper border extending to L5/S1. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-FU, administered alone or combined with other drugs. Seventy-six of the 125 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy that, in most cases, consisted of 4–6 cycles of 5-FU (370 mg/㎡ /day and leucovorin (LV) 100 mg/㎡/ day, bolus on days 1–5 every 28). The differences in preoperative and/or postoperative regimens used were related to: (a) the time when treatment was given during the initial study period, we routinely used 5-FU bolus with low-dose LV combined with external beam RT (45 Gy in 25 fractions), whereas more recent routine treatment has included continuous venous infusion of 5-FU and external beam RT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions); (b) enrolment of patients with different treatment regimens in clinical trials; (c) the different attitudes of the referring radiotherapy and oncology units.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether germline methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms as well as polymorphisms in the thymidylate synthase gene promoter, namely the variable number tandem repeat polymorphism (TS VNTR) and the intrarepeat G to C single nucleotide polymorphism (TS SNP), are predictive markers of tumor regression in rectal cancer patients following preoperative chemoradiotherapy. BASIC METHODS: Blood samples from 125 patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the mid-low rectum who received 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy (median dose 48.4 Gy), 125 patients (women n=45, men n=80; median age 60 years, range 31-79 years) were genotyped. Response to preoperative treatment was evaluated employing the Tumor Regression Grade criteria. On the basis of the pathologic response, patients were classified as responders (TRG 1-2, n=48) and non-responders (TRG 3-5, n=74). Three patients were excluded because of insufficient data. MAIN RESULTS: Among the polymorphic variants examined, the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype was, upon univariate analysis, the only variable found associated with tumor regression (P=0.004). Moreover, at multivariate analysis, the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype was an independent predictor of tumor regression. Patients not carrying the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype (odds ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.13-0.64, P=0.002) displayed a higher response rate than patients with the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike TS VNTR and SNP polymorphisms, MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype in genomic DNA has the potential to be a predictive marker of tumor response in rectal cancer patients submitted to preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

227	The Glu228Ala polymorphism in the ligand binding domain of death receptor 4 is associated with increased risk for prostate cancer metastases	English	2008	18163425	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18163425	Journal Article	\N	702	702	\N	\N	68	\N	All patients received radiation therapy and 409 (58.3%) patients underwent neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: Death receptor 4, encoded by the TNFRSF10A gene, is an important mediator of apoptosis and its dysfunction may be related to cancer development and distant tumor spread. A single nucleotide polymorphism in TNFRSF10A (Glu228Ala, rs20576) within a conserved region of the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of death receptor 4 has been associated with an increased risk for a variety of tumor entities. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the TNFRSF10A polymorphism in metastatic progression of prostate cancer after radiation therapy. METHODS: We carried out a prospective study including 702 prostate cancer patients from the Austrian PROCAGENE (Prostate Cancer Genetics) study. Development of metastases was examined in regular follow-up investigations. TNFRSF10A genotypes were determined by a 5'-nuclease assay (TaqMan). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up time of 10 months (range 0-60 months), 24 (3.4%) patients developed metastases. In a Cox regression model including age at diagnosis and risk group as potential confounders, carriage of an 228Ala allele was associated with a relative risk of 2.47 (95% CI 1.10-5.54; P=0.028) for metastases. TNFRSF10A genotypes were not associated with tumor stage, grade, risk group or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the TNFRSF10A Glu228Ala polymorphism may be a novel independent risk factor for prostate cancer metastases after radiation therapy.

Methods: A total of 122 cases with pathologically confirmed advanced esophageal cancer who were admitted in our hospital from March 2009 to March 2013 were recruited in this study. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan was designed for the primary tumors and lymph drainage area, and the primary lesion was given 40 Gy/20 f and prior TP scheme chemotherapy. Direct sequencing is used to analyze the XRCC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 122 cases. Kaplan-Mieier method was used to analyze the correlation of XRCC1 gene classification with the total survival time. Results: XRCC1 gene polymorphisms showed the following expression pattens Arg399Gln GG, GA and AA, and the distribution frequency were 54 cases, 49 cases, and 19 cases in subjects. The  carriers of GA and AA genotypes had a significantly increased risk for death when compared with the GG genotype patients (GA vs GG, HR=3.164, 95%ci: 1.914-5.230; AA vs GG, HR=6.868, 95%CI: 3.549-13.289). Conclusion: XRCC1 Arg399Gln single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with esophageal radiation and chemotherapy sensitivity. The GG genotype carriers have better prognosis after chemoradiotherapy.	The Journal of Third Military Medical University	T1-2: 21 patients, T3-4: 101 patients; N0: 34 patients, N1-3: 88 patients.
229	Association between miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in double-strand break repair genes and risk of recurrence in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the non-oropharynx	English	2017	28334093	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28334093	Journal Article	\N	697	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Genetic polymorphisms at miRNA-binding sites may affect miRNA-mediated gene regulation. Thus, miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in double-strand break (DSB) repair genes may affect DNA repair capacity, which in turn could affect cancer prognosis. To determine whether miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in DSB repair genes are associated with the risk of recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the non-oropharynx (SCCNOP), we used a log-rank test and multivariable Cox models to evaluate the associations between miRNA-binding site polymorphisms in DSB repair genes and SCCNOP recurrence. Compared with patients without common homozygous genotypes, patients with the variant genotypes of ATM rs227091, LIG3 rs4796030, and RAD51 rs7180135 had significantly better disease-free survival (DFS) (log-rank P = 0.046, 0.002, and 0.041, respectively) and lower risk of disease recurrence [HR (95% CI) = 0.7 (0.6-0.9), 0.6 (0.5-0.9), and 0.7 (0.6-0.9), respectively]. Furthermore, patients with the variant genotypes of these 3 polymorphisms had significantly lower recurrence risk than those without common homozygous genotypes did [HR = 0.3 (95% CI = 0.2-0.7)]. Among patients who received chemoradiation, those with the individual or combined variant genotypes of the three polymorphisms had a significantly lower risk of disease recurrence than those with the individual or combined common homozygous genotypes did. The individual or combined variant genotypes of the ATM rs227091, LIG3 rs4796030, and RAD51 rs7180135 polymorphisms significantly modify the risk of SCCNOP recurrence, particularly for patients treated with chemoradiation. Future prospective studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to validate these findings to enable more effective personalized treatment for SCCNOP patients.	Carcinogenesis	\N

Methods: A total of 203 locoregionally advanced NPC patients were enrolled in the study. 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) belong to 13 genes in the radiotherapy and chemotherapy action pathways were examined. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were employed for analysis. Results: Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the patients carried rs25487 AA, rs1136410 CC+TT genotype had lower OS (overall survival rates); the patients carried rs2032582 AT genotype had lower LRFS (locoregional relapse free survival rates); the patients carried rs25487 AA, rs2010963 CC, rs833061 CT+TT genotypes had lowerdmfs (distant metastasis free survival rates); the patients carried rs3212986 GG,  rs25487 AA, rs2030582 AT, rs2279744 GG+GT genotypes had lower PFS (progression free survival rates). Cox analysis showed that the aformentioned SNPs were the independent influence factors to the correspondingly survival rate except rs833061 (P<0.05). Conclusion: A few SNPs in radiotherapt or chemotherapy action pathways are prognositc factors for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC, which provided new molecular factors to evaluate the prognosis and perform individualized treatments.

Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that K-ras is direct targeting gene of let-7a.As prognostic analysis showed,individuals with rs10877887 had no effect on efficacy and prognosis,while individuals with rs13293512 CC genotype or rs712 TT and non-GG genotypes had a lower effective treatment rate and shor-ter median PFS time (P <0.05).Cox logistic analysis revealed that LNM ,Ⅳstage,rs13293512 CC and rs712 TT genotypes are ESCC risk factors.Conclusion Rs13293512 CC and rs712 TT genotypes increase the risk and the resistance of chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced ESCC,and lower the efficacy of che-moradiotherapy and median PFS time,which implicated sensitivity of patients to chemoradiotherapy can be potentially predicted by genotyping before the chemoradiotherapy.

Methods: The study population consisted of 96 intensity-modulated radition therapy (IMRT)-treated nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients with informed consent. Genome DNA was extracted from the blood. Genotypes were determined by polymorase chain reaction-restriction combined with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) or PCR-single base extension assays. Acute radiodermatitis was scored using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events v 4.0 scale. The population was divided into CTC 0-2 and CTC 3+ group for the analysis for each acute radiodermatitis. Results: In the 96 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated with IMRT. 25 patients  (26%) experienced ≥grade 3 acute radiodermatitis. Patients with the TERF2 rs251796  TC genotype have higher risk compared with patients with the TT genotype (OR=5.17, 95%CI=1.26-17.15, P=0.01). What's more, patients carrying rs251796 TC and CC genotype have higher risk compared with these carrying TT genotype (OR=4.07, 95% CI=1.27-13.08, P=0.02). For the rest of SNPs, the study did not show any significant associations with the risk of acute radiodermatitis.

After another 2-week interval, the patients with locally advanced ESCC who showed an objective response to treatment received additional chemotherapy with PVIs of 5-FU (400 mg/㎡/24 hours for days 1–5 and 8–12) and CDDP (40 mg/㎡/3 hours on days 1 and 8), and this treatment was repeated at least 2 times at 2-week intervals. If disease progression/recurrence was observed, salvage surgery, endoscopic treatment, or another regimen of chemotherapy was scheduled. In this study, salvage surgery or endoscopic treatment was done for 4 and 2 of 31 patients, respectively. All patients received the total parenteral nutrition prior to the CRT, and the nutritional support was continued as possible.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	OBJECTIVES: This study was performed to find the genetic factors predictive of clinical outcome to a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in Japanese patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with stage I-IVa ESCC (I/II/III/IVa = 7/7/14/3) were enrolled in this study. One course of treatment consisted of protracted venous infusions (PVIs) of 5-FU (400 mg/m2/24 hours for days 1-5 and 8-12), CDDP (40 mg/m2/3 hours on days 1 and 8) and radiation (2 Gy/d on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19), and a 2nd course was successively repeated after a 2-week interval. A total of 8 measurements of the plasma concentration of 5-FU were made using high performance liquid chromatography. Genetic polymorphisms examined herein included those in the genes coding thymidylate synthase (TS), glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1), multidrug resistant transporter MDR1/P-glycoprotein, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and in a circadian rhythm-relating gene, CLOCK. RESULTS: The CR rate depended on stage (P = 0.001), but the analysis was not sufficiently powered to reach a level of statistical significance for the 2-year survival rate (P = 0.061). For stage II/III patients, to have 2 or 3 polymorphisms of 3R/3R of 5'-TSER, a 6 bp of 3'-TSUTR, and GSTP1-Ile105Val resulted in an extensively longer survival (P = 0.020), although no difference was found between 2 groups, with respect to the plasma concentrations of 5-FU and clinicopathologic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic index may allow predictions of the clinical outcome of a 5-FU/CDDP-based CRT in stage II/III ESCC patients.

Methods: Eleven functional haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) of SDC were genotyped in 296 ESCC patients who received radiotherapy alone, and had different response and esophagatis. The associations between genotypes and risk of esophagitis were measured by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confiednce intervals (CIs), adjusted for sex, age, tumnor location, staing, radiotherapy mode and total radiation dose. The hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: The median survival time (MST) of these patients was 14 months. Of them, 260 (87.8%) had died until the last date of follow-up of 30 June, 2014. Clinical stage ( stage Ⅳ vs. stage Ⅱ) and total radiation dose (≥ 60 Gy vs. <60 Gy) influence the overall survival time of the patient significantly. Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis showed that the subjects with rs61599409 T allele had an decreased hazard ratio as compared with those with C allele ( adjusted HR=0.82, 95% CI, 0.66-1.02) , but the difference was not statistically significant ( P=0.071) . The rest 10 htSNPs were not associated with the overall survival of ESCC patients treated with radiotherapy. Among this set of patients, 160 ( 54. 1%) suffered from radiation esophagitis. We found that rs17788084 A > T SNP in the 3′untranslational region of SDC2 was associated with esophagitis risk, with the OR being 0.48 (95% CI=0.28-0.85, P=0.011) for the TA or TT genotype compared with the AA genotype. Conclusions These results suggest that rs17788084 genetic variation in SDC2 is associated with risk of radiation esophagitis and might serve as a potential biomarker for personalized radiotherapy of ESCC.

237	Relationship Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of ERCC1 ,XRCC1 and Efficacy of Radiochemotherapy in Patients with Nasopharyngeal Cancer	Chinese	2017	\N	http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_zlxzz201701008	Journal Article	\N	100	72	28	50.5	\N	[19.0,77.0)	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Objective: To investigate the relationship between single nicleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of ERCC1, XRCC1 genes and efficacy of radiochemotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Methods: One hundred patients with pathologically proved NPC received first-line cisplatin-based concurrent radiochemotherapy. SNPs in ERCC1 and XRCC1 were assessed with 5' nuclease allelic discrimination assay (TaqMan) by real-time polymorase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing. The sieze of tumor was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after treatment completion adn 3 years after treatment. The relationship between genotypes of ERCC1, XRCC1, and short-term response of chemo-radiotherapy showed no significant correlation with the polymorphisms of ERCC1(118) and XRCC1(399) genes (P>0.05). The 1-, 2-, 3-year overall survival rates after radiochemotherapy in patients with genotypes of GG and AA/GA of XRCC1(399) were 97.7%, 94.3%, 86.3%, and 98.2%, 87.4%, 73.8%, respectively (P<0.05). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of ERCC1 and XRCC1 in NPC have no correlation with the short-term response of radiochemotherapy, but have significant correlation with overall survival of petients. Polymorphisms of ERCC1 and XRCC1 may be used as predictors of survival for NPC patients receiving radiochemotherapy.

This aim is to inestigate the correlation of SNP-rs699947 in VEGF promoter region with the short-term effect and toxicity in cervical cancer after radiotherapy. Methods: Fifty-two cases of pathologically confirmed cervical squamous cell cancer stage I B2-IIIB in our hospital from 1st March 2013 to 1st March 2014 were included, and all cases received concurrent chemoradiotherapy: external radiation therapy combined 252 Californium Brachytherapy with cisplatin chemotherapy. Two copies of venous blood samples were collected for every case before treatment, one copy was used to detect serum VEGF levels by ELISA after centrifugation, and genomic DNA was extracted from the other copy, Specific primers PCR were designed to amplify VEGF gene promoter region fragment, single nucleotide polymorphism of rs699947 were inspected by gene sequencing. All patients were followed up to years, then the correlation between VEGF-rs699947 genotype with serum VEGF contenr lever, short-term efficacy and toxicity side were analyzed. Results: In all samples, there were 6 cases whose SNP rs699947 were confirmed AA type, 26 were AC type, and 20 were CC type. The serum VEGF levels of group AA type, CC type and AA type were (231.71±72.12,), (372.45±129.14), (298.16±99.45) ug/L, the difference was statistical sifnificance (F=4.74, P=0.013), and AC-type group weas higher than those of AA-type group (P=0.008). As short-term effect, complete remission rate (CR) of AA, CC and AC were 4/6, 8/20. 20/26, the difference was statistically significant (chi-square=6.59, P=0.037), but no significant difference the total effective rate (chi-square=2.6, P=0.027). The incidence of toxicity effects (radiation procitis and radiocystitis) of CC-type group was 20.0% (4/20), and significantly lower than the AC-type group 50.0% (13/26, chi-square=4.36, P=0.037), but no statistical sifnificance compared to AA (P=0.596). Conclusions: Serum VEGF levels significantly correlation with VEGF single nucleotide polymorphism (rs699947) C/A mutation located in promoter region. Cervical cancer paitents with CC have higher serum VEGF levels, but poor short-time effect and less toxicity than these of AC and AA when rceived chemoradiotherapy. VEGF gene SNP (rs699947) mutation possibly influence short-term efficacy and toxicity through regulating the expression of VEGF in cervical cancer.

Using IMRT technique total doses of 66–70 Gy (daily dose 2 Gy) were prescribed. Patients with gross disease were treated with total dose 70 Gy in 35 fractions for tumor and enlarged lymph nodes. Elective lymph nodes were treated with doses of 54 Gy or 60 Gy; Patients after surgical resection were given a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions for high risk volume, the intermediate and low risk subclinical volumes received 60 Gy and 54 Gy, respectively. Moreover patients were treated with chemotherapy based on cisplatine and 5-fluorouracil (PF) schemes. 1 to 4 courses of chemotherapy were administered.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Every year, about 650 thousand new cases of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) are diagnosed globally. Apart from surgery, radiotherapy (RTH), chemotherapy (CHT) or its combination is used in the treatment of HNC. One of the most frequent complications and, at the same time, limitations of RTH is oral mucositis (OM). Proinflammatory cytokines (including TNF-α) play a key role in the development of OM. Genetic alterations, i.e. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes encoding for receptors for TNF (ie. TNFRSF1A) may change their function. The aim of this study was to investigate relationship between a polymorphism of TNFRSF1A and occurrence and severity of acute reaction after RTH for HNC patients. Data from 58 HNC patients (stages I-IV) were analyzed. All of them were irradiated using IMRT technique with doses 50-70Gy. Oral mucositis (OM) was evaluated according to RTOG/EORTC guidelines. DNA from HNC patients were isolated from whole blood and genotypes were determined by sequencing method. Patients with TT or GT genotype demonstrated higher risk of manifestation of grade 3 OM in 5th week of RTH (p=0.041; OR=9.240; 95% CI: 1.101-77.581) compared to GG carriers. Similarly, high risk of grade 3 OM in patients with T allele presence was noted in 6th week (p=0.030; OR=10.50; 95%CI:1.257-87.690) and in 7th week (p=0.008; OR=5.625; 95% CI: 1.584-19.975) of treatment compared to patients with GG homozygote. Our results indicate an association between SNP of TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) gene and risk of more severe OM related to radiation therapy for HNC patients.

We hypothesized that genetic variations in RGS gene family may be associated with the response of late-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. We selected 95 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 17 RGS genes and genotyped them in 598 late-stage NSCLC patients. Thirteen SNPs were significantly associated with overall survival. Among them, rs2749786 of RGS12 was most significant. Stratified analysis by chemotherapy or chemoradiation further identified SNPs that were associated with overall survival in subgroups. Rs2816312 of RGS1 and rs6689169 of RGS7 were most significant in chemotherapy group and chemoradiotherapy group, respectively. A significant cumulative effect was observed when these SNPs were combined. Survival tree analyses identified potential interactions between rs944343, rs2816312, and rs1122794 in affecting survival time in patients treated with chemotherapy, while the genotype of rs6429264 affected survival in chemoradiation-treated patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the importance of RGS gene family in the survival of late-stage NSCLC patients.	Plos One	\N

Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent malignant primary brain tumor in adults and, despite recent advances, the prognosis for this cancer remains dismal. The aims of this study were to test the influence of XRCC1 rs25487, XRCC3 rs861539, XRCC3 rs1799794, RAD51 rs1801320 and GSTP-1 rs1695 single nucleotide polymorphisms on progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in GBM patients treated with radiotherapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ). Fifty GBM patients treated with upfront radio-chemotherapy (RT 60 Gy/30 sessions; TMZ 75 mg/m2 during RT and 200 mg/m2 days 1 → 5 every 28 days) were enrolled. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to evaluate differences between curves. A trend to a statistically significant association with PFS in univariate and multivariate COX regression analysis was found with GSTP-1 rs1695 polymorphism (p = 0.087 and p = 0.097 on univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively). Conversely, the same GSTP-1 rs1695 SNP revealed a statistically significant association with OS (p = 0.007 and p = 0.042 on univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively). Our pharmacogenetic prospective study suggests that GSTP-1 rs1695 genotypes can be associated with different OS in GBM patients treated with RT and TMZ.	Investigational New Drugs	\N

Patients who displayed response to the therapy underwent a potentially curative pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	SEL1L is a putative tumor suppressor gene that is frequently down-regulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs12435998 in intron3 of SEL1L has previously been reported to be associated with susceptibility to Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that this SNP may influence clinical outcomes of patients with PDA. We analyzed DNA samples from 497 Caucasian patients with pathologically confirmed primary PDA. Of these, 98 had been enrolled in a clinical trial of neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and 77 of the 98 had subsequently undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). We performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to evaluate the correlation between different SNP genotypes and age at diagnosis, survival time after diagnosis, and survival time after PD. In nonsmokers, we found a significant difference in median age at diagnosis between variant genotypes (AG/GG) carriers and wild-type genotype (AA) carriers (58 vs. 62 yr; log-rank test, P = 0.017). Patients with variant genotypes also showed an increased hazard ratio (HR) of 1.45 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.97] relative to wild-type genotype. Among the patients in the clinical trial, the variant genotypes carriers had a median post-PD survival time that was 34.7 months shorter than wild-type genotype carriers (log-rank test, P = 0.019; HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.09-3.34). Our results suggest that the rs12435998 SNP in SEL1L gene plays a role in modifying age at diagnosis of PDA in Caucasian nonsmokers. In addition, this SNP may serve as a prognostic marker in PDA patients who undergo the same or similar treatment as the clinical trials.	Molecular Carcinogenesis	\N

Cisplatin (20 mg/㎡ per day) was administered as a short-term infusion on days 1–5, and 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/㎡ per day) was administered as a continuous infusion over 24 h on days 1–5. Radiation was delivered in daily fractions of 1.8 Gy (days 1–5, 8–12, 15–19, and 22–26) to a total dose of 36–40 Gy using a multiple field technique. Surgical resection was performed 4–5 weeks following completion of radiochemotherapy and after clinical restaging.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	BACKGROUND: Currently, patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer receive neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy but only about half of these patients benefit from this treatment. GNAS T393C has been shown to predict the postoperative course in solid tumors and may therefore be useful for treatment stratification. The aim of the present study was to determine if the single-nucleotide polymorphism GNAS T393C can be used for treatment stratification in esophageal cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 596 patients underwent surgical resection for esophageal carcinoma from 1996 to 2008; 279 patients received chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery (RTX-SURG group). All patients and a reference group of 820 healthy White individuals were genotyped for GNAS T393C. RESULTS: The 5-year-survival rate for the 317 patients who underwent esophagectomy as initial treatment (SURG group) was 57 % for homozygous C-allele carriers (n = 99) and 43 % for T-allele carriers (n = 218; log- rank test p = 0.025). Multivariate analysis revealed the GNAS T393C genotype (p = 0.034), pT (p < 0.001), pN (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) as prognostic of survival. Homozygous C-allele carriers with a locally advanced tumor stage (cT3/T4, n = 129) in the SURG group had a 5-year survival rate of 37 %, which, remarkably, exceeded the 5-year survival rate of 30 % for the entire RTX-SURG group (n = 279). In the RTX-SURG group, the GNAS T393C genotype did not show any prognostic significance. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a locally advanced esophageal cancer and an homozygous GNAS 393C genotype do not benefit from platinum-based neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, indicating that these patients should be treated by alternative treatment strategies.

A total of four cycles of gemcitabine were administered, with each cycle consisting of gemcitabine (1000 mg/㎡ per week) three weeks out of four.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	The aim of this study is to validate the prognostic and predictive value of the non-synonymous cytidine deaminase (CDA) Lys²⁷Gln polymorphism for hematological toxicity and survival using a randomized phase III adjuvant trial (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9704) in pancreatic cancer in which one treatment arm received gemcitabine. CDA is involved in gemcitabine inactivation, and there is conflicting data on the role of the non-synonymous CDA Lys²⁷Gln polymorphism in predicting toxicity and survival in cancer patients treated with gemcitabine. RTOG 9704 randomized 538 patients after pancreatic resection to receive radiotherapy with either 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. CDA Lys²⁷Gln polymorphism genotype was analyzed. We tested an association between CDA single-nucleotide polymorphism genotype and the survival outcome by the Cox proportional hazard model adjusting for other covariates, as well as toxicity by the logistic regression model. There is statistically significant more severe hematological toxicity in patients treated with gemcitabine with either the homozygote wild-type genotype (Lys/Lys) alone (odds ratio (OR)=0.06, P=0.01), or in combination with the heterozygote (Lys/Gln; OR=0.14, P=0.03) when compared with homozygote variant genotype (Gln/Gln) when adjusted for other covariates. This was not seen in the non-gemcitabine treated arm. There are no genotype differences with respect to survival outcome. In conclusion, in this prospective randomized adjuvant study of patients with pancreatic cancer, the CDA Lys²⁷Gln polymorphism is validated as a predictive marker of gemcitabine hematological toxicity, but not with treatment response or survival.

247	IL6 genotype, tumour ER-status, and treatment predicted disease-free survival in a prospective breast cancer cohort	English	2014	25305747	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25305747	Journal Article	\N	335	\N	335	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: In breast cancer, high levels of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been associated with disease-free survival and treatment resistance. Increased serum levels of IL-6 have been correlated with increased levels of NF-κβ and aromatase expression in adipose tissue. Several IL6 single nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with breast cancer prognosis, but the impact may differ depending on tumour oestrogen receptor (ER) status. This translational study investigated the association between IL6 genotypes, ER-status, and treatment on the risk of early events among breast cancer patients. METHODS: The study included 634 25- to 99-year-old primary breast cancer patients in Sweden from 2002-2008. Genotyped IL6 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1800797, rs1800796, rs1800795, and rs2069849 were analysed separately and as diplotypes. Disease-free survival was assessed for 567 patients. Clinical data, patient-, and tumour-characteristics were obtained from questionnaires, patient charts, population registries, and pathology reports. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5.1 years. IL6 diplotype was not associated with early events for all 567 patients, but AGCC/AGCC diplotype-carriers with ER-negative tumours had an increased risk, (adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) = 5.91, 95% CI: 1.28-27.42). Any C-carriers (rs1800795) with ER-negative tumours had a higher risk of early events than GG-carriers with ER-negative tumours, (adjusted HR = 3.76, 95% CI: 1.05-13.43), particularly after radiotherapy (adjusted HR = 7.17, 95% CI: 1.16-32.28). Irrespective of ER-status, chemotherapy-treated Any C-carriers had a higher risk of early events than GG-carriers (adjusted HR = 3.42, 95% CI: 1.01-11.54). CONCLUSIONS: The main finding of the present study was that IL6 genotype was strongly associated with early events among patients with ER-negative tumours, particularly among radiotherapy-treated patients, and among chemotherapy-treated patients irrespective of ER-status. The high risk for early events observed in these subgroups of patients suggests that combined information on IL6 genotype, tumour ER-status, and breast cancer treatment may represent a tool for identifying patients who require more personalised treatment.

Uniform radiotherapy protocols for conventional two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) at the SYSUCC were followed as previously described. Radiotherapy was administered 5 times per week at 2 Gy/d for 2D-CRT and at 2.27 Gy/d for IMRT. The accumulated radiation doses were 68-72 Gy to the primary tumor, 60-62 Gy to the involved areas of the neck and 50 Gy to the uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered to all patients. Altogether, 28.7% and 25.9% of the patients received induction and adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively (Table 1). For induction chemotherapy, 2 cycles of PF chemotherapy were administered [cisplatin 100 mg/㎡ i.v. drip on day 1 and 5-FU 1,000 mg/(㎡ ·d) continuous i.v. for 120 hours, repeated every 3 weeks]. For concurrent chemotherapy, cisplatin was administered at 100 mg/㎡ on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy or at 40 mg/㎡ weekly during radiotherapy. For adjuvant chemotherapy, concurrent CRT followed by a combination of cisplatin (80 mg/㎡ ) plus 5-FU [1000 mg/(㎡ ·d)] was administered by 96-hour infusion every four weeks for three cycles.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment outcomes vary greatly in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the influence of radiation and chemotherapy drug action pathway gene polymorphisms on the survival of patients with locoregionally advanced NPC treated with cisplatin- and fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four hundred twenty-one consecutive patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were prospectively recruited. We utilized a pathway approach and examined 18 polymorphisms in 13 major genes. Polymorphisms were detected using the LDR-PCR technique. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis was performed to detect potential gene-gene interaction. RESULTS: After adjustment for clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival was significantly decreased in patients with the MPO rs2243828 CT/CC genotype (HR=2.453, 95% CI, 1.687-3.566, P<0.001). The ERCC1 rs3212986 CC (HR=1.711, 95% CI, 1.135-2.579, P=0.010), MDM2 rs2279744 GT/GG (HR=1.743, 95% CI, 1.086-2.798, P=0.021), MPO rs2243828 CT/CC (HR=3.184, 95% CI, 2.261-4.483, P<0.001) and ABCB1 rs2032582 AT/AA (HR=1.997, 95% CI, 1.086-3.670, P=0.026) genotypes were associated with poor progression-free survival. Prognostic score models based on independent prognostic factors successfully classified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. Furthermore, MDR analysis showed no significant interaction between polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Four single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with survival in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC treated with cisplatin- and fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy. Combining clinical prognostic factors with genetic information was valuable in identifying patients with different risk.	Plos One	Stage III: 284 patients, Stage IVA-B: 137 patients.

The most common high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy dose and fractionation was 25 Gy in four or five fractions. Concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy at 30 mg/㎡ was administered for 5 cycles during external beam radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate polymorphisms in DNA repair genes as potential predictive factors among Chinese cervical cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 72 patients with cervical carcinoma, who received cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy and whose responses were evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, were included. The association between response to chemoradiotherapy and the genotypes for 29 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 25 DNA repair genes were analyzed. RESULTS: A minor allele of SNP rs9350 in the exonuclease 1 gene was associated with a better response rate, regardless of age and tumor stage (odds ratio, 8.316; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: SNP rs9350 in the exonuclease 1 gene is involved in inter-individual differences in the response to cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy, in patients with cervical carcinoma.

249	Effects of ERCC2 Lys751Gln (A35931C) and CCND1 (G870A) polymorphism on outcome of advanced-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are treatment dependent	English	2011	21890746	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21890746	Journal Article	\N	275	219	56	\N	\N	\N	275 stage III–IV cases that were initially treated with radiation (with or without chemotherapy).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: Germline variation in DNA damage response may explain variable treatment outcomes in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). By grouping patients according to stage and radiation treatment, we compared SCCHN survival with regard to ERCC2 A35931C (Lys751Gln, rs13181) and CCND1 G870A (Pro241Pro, rs9344) genotypes. METHODS: In a hospital-based SCCHN case series (all white, 24.7% female, mean age 58.4 years), this treatment-outcome cohort study genotyped 275 stage III-IV cases that were initially treated with radiation (with or without chemotherapy) and 80 stage III-IV and 130 stage I-II cases that were initially treated without radiation or chemotherapy and used Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses to compare genotype groups on the basis of overall, disease-specific, progression-free, and recurrence-free survival rates. RESULTS: ERCC2 35931 AA predicted worse survival in stage III-IV cases treated with radiation [multiply-adjusted HR = 1.66, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.15-2.40; HR over the first 3 follow-up years = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.28-2.88] and better survival in stage III-IV cases not treated with radiation (HR = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.62). Although not associated with survival in stage III-IV cancers treated with radiation (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.67-1.51), CCND1-870 GG predicted better survival in stage III-IV cancers not treated with radiation (HR = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.50). Survival in stage I-II did not depend on ERCC2 A35931C or CCND1 G870A genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Although promoting tumor progression in untreated patients, germline differences in DNA-repair or cell-cycle control may improve treatment outcome in patients treated with DNA-damaging agents. IMPACT: ERCC2 A35931C may help distinguish advanced stage SCCHN with better outcomes from radiation treatment.

250	CYP19 genetic polymorphism haplotype AASA is associated with a poor prognosis in premenopausal women with lymph node-negative, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer	English	2013	24324964	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24324964	Journal Article	\N	296	\N	296	50	\N	[24.0,81.0)	All enrolled patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to all patients after breast conserving surgery. All patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy received an optimal dose of radiation (a biologically equivalent dose of 50–60Gy in 2-Gy fractions).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Hormone therapy	5	Given the critical role of CYP19 in estrogen synthesis, we investigated the influence of CYP19 gene polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of lymph node- (LN-) negative, hormone receptor- (HR-) positive early breast cancers. Genotyping for the CYP19 polymorphisms rs4646 (A/C), rs1065779 (A/C), CYP19 (TTTA)n (short allele/long (S/L) allele using the 7 TTTA repeat polymorphism as the cut-off), and rs1870050 (A/C) was performed on 296 patients with LN-negative, HR-positive breast cancers. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Associations were examined between these 4 genotypes and 6 common haplotypes of CYP19 and distant disease-free survival (DDFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Patients were divided into the 6 subhaplotypes of CCLA (41.1%), AASA (17.1%), CASA (11.9%), CCLC (8.9%), CCSA (7.5%), AASC (8.9%), and others (4.6%). In premenopausal patients, haplotype AASA was significantly associated with a poor DDFS (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR), 3.3; P = 0.001), DFS (aHR, 2.5; P = 0.0008), and OS (aHR, 2.9; P = 0.0004) after adjusting for age, tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, chemotherapy, pathology, adjuvant hormone therapy, menopausal status, and radiotherapy. Furthermore, haplotype AASA remained a negative prognostic factor for premenopausal patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of DDFS (aHR, 4.5; P = 0.0005), DFS (HR, 3.2; P = 0.003), and OS (HR, 6.4; P = 0.0009). However, in postmenopausal patients, haplotype AASA was not associated with a poor prognosis, whereas the AASC haplotype was significantly associated with a poor DFS (aHR, 3.1; P = 0.03) and OS (aHR, 4.4; P = 0.01). Our results indicate that, in patients with LN-negative, HR-positive breast cancers, genetic polymorphism haplotype AASA is associated with poor survival of premenopausal women but does not affect survival of postmenopausal women.

251	Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in CBLB, a Regulator of T-Cell Response, Predict Radiation Pneumonitis and Outcomes After Definitive Radiotherapy for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer	English	2016	26732495	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26732495	Journal Article	White; Black	393	218	175	\N	\N	\N	All of whom received deﬁnitive radiotherapy as the initial treatment; some of these patients also received chemotherapy, either concurrent with or subsequent to the radiotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	BACKGROUND: The immune system has important roles in tumor development and outcomes after cancer treatment. We evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding casitas B-lineage lymphoma b protein (Cbl-b), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that maintains immune tolerance by negatively regulating T-cell activation and function, were associated with outcomes after treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 393 patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy at a single institution between March 1998 and February 2009 were used to genotype 3 potentially functional SNPs in CBLB (rs1042852 C>T, rs2305035 G>A, and rs7649466 C>G). We evaluated associations between these SNPs and local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP). RESULTS: Having the rs2305035 A variant genotypes (AA or AG) was associated with better local recurrence-free survival (median 15.8 vs. 15.3 months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.98; P = .033), distant metastasis-free survival (median 15.4 vs. 14.0 months; adjusted HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; P = .024) and overall survival (median 23.5 vs. 22.8 months; adjusted HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93; P = .013) after adjustment in a Cox proportional hazard model. Patients with these genotypes were also at greater risk of developing grade 3 or higher RP than were patients with GG genotypes in an adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. CONCLUSION: This is the first report that rs2305035 genotypes in CBLB were associated with clinical and RP risk among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy. These findings could assist in generating hypothesis for further mechanistic studies.	Clinical Lung Cancer	Stage I-II: 55 patients, Stage III: 309 patients, Stage IV: 27 patients.
255	BCL2 genotypes and prostate cancer survival	English	2017	28396899	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28396899	Journal Article	\N	702	702	\N	\N	\N	\N	All patients underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer. The clinical target volume included the entire prostate and the base of the seminal vesicles. A safety margin of 10mm was added in all directions to create the planning target volume (PTV). High-energy photons (18MV) were delivered in a three-field technique using an anterior and two lateral fields to encompass the PTV. A subgroup of patients (n = 110) received postoperative radiotherapy using high-energy photons (18MV) in a conformal three-field technique to treat the prostate bed. All fields were treated daily, 5days/week. The total dose prescribed to the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurement point was 66 to 70.4Gy delivered in 1.8–2Gy per fraction. None of the included patients received pelvic node irradiation. A total of 454 patients (64.7%) received neoadjuvant ADT (androgen deprivation therapy) and 153 patients (21.8%) were treated with additional adjuvant ADT. The administration of ADT was at the discretion of the treating urologists and generally recommended in intermediate- and high-risk patients.	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	PURPOSE: The antiapoptotic B‑cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene is a key player in cancer development and progression. A functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (c.-938C>A, rs2279115) in the inhibitory P2 BCL2 gene promoter has been associated with clinical outcomes in various types of cancer. Aim of the present study was to analyze the role of BCL2-938C>A genotypes in prostate cancer mortality. METHODS: The association between BCL2-938C>A (rs2279115) genotypes and prostate cancer outcome was studied within the prospective PROCAGENE study comprising 702 prostate cancer patients. RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 92 months, 120 (17.1%) patients died. A univariate Cox regression model showed a significant association of the CC genotype with reduced cancer-specific survival (CSS; hazard ratio, HR, 2.13, 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.10-4.12; p = 0.024) and overall survival (OS; HR 2.34, 95% CI 1.58-3.47; p < 0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression model including age at diagnosis, risk group, and androgen deprivation therapy, the CC genotype remained a significant predictor of poor CSS (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.05-3.99; p = 0.034) and OS (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51-3.36; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the homozygous BCL2-938 CC genotype is associated with OS and C in prostate cancer patients.

256	Common variation in BRCA1 may have a role in progression to lethal prostate cancer after radiation treatment	English	2016	26926928	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26926928	Journal Article	\N	802	802	\N	\N	72.0999999999999943	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Hormone therapy	5	BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reflecting common variation in the tumor suppressor BRCA1 affect prostate cancer outcomes. Because radiation therapy (RT) induces DNA damage, we hypothesized that common variation in BRCA1 has a role in progression to lethal prostate cancer, particularly in patients receiving RT. METHODS: We followed 802 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (cT1-T3/N0/M0) who were treated with RT in the US Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) and Physicians' Health Study (PHS), for progression to lethal prostate cancer. Six SNPs (rs3737559, rs1799950, rs799923, rs915945, rs4474733 and rs8176305) were genotyped in HPFS to capture common variation across BRCA1. rs4474733 and rs8176305 were also evaluated in the PHS cohort. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate per-allele hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) stratified by primary treatment. RESULTS: In the RT group (n=802), 71 men progressed to lethal disease during a mean follow-up of 12 years. We found that two SNPs, rs4473733 (HR: 0.65; 95% CI 0.42-0.99) and rs8176305 (HR: 2.03; 95% CI 1.33-3.10), were associated with lethal prostate cancer in men receiving RT. CONCLUSIONS: Common variation in BRCA1 may influence clinical outcomes in patients receiving RT for localized prostate cancer by modifying the response to RT. Our findings merit further follow-up studies to validate these SNPs and better understand their functional and biological significance.

257	Genetic sequence variants in vitamin D metabolism pathway genes, serum vitamin D level and outcome in head and neck cancer patients	English	2013	23169318	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23169318	Journal Article	\N	522	413	109	63	\N	[33.0,86.0)	522 Stages I–II radiation-treated patients with Head and neck cancer.	Radiotherapy	5	Although some studies have reported associations between serum vitamin D level and prognosis in several cancers, others have found associations between genetic sequence variants (GSVs) in the vitamin D metabolism pathway genes and outcomes in various cancers including head and neck cancer (HNC). We comprehensively evaluated the association and interaction of GSVs in vitamin D metabolism pathway genes and their regulatory effects on circulatory serum vitamin D level in HNC outcome. We systemically evaluated the association of 89 tagging and candidate-based GSVs in six major vitamin D metabolism pathway genes (VDR, GC, CYP24A1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1 and CYP2R1) and the circulating serum vitamin D level with overall survival (OS) and second primary cancer (SPC) in 522 Stages I-II radiation-treated patients with HNC. For OS: median follow-up time was 8 years; for SPC, 4.4 years. The most common subsite was the larynx (84%). Three hundred and twelve patients were alive at the end of follow-up for OS. SPCs were diagnosed in 108 patients and were primarily of lung (46%). Serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in patients carrying the minor alleles of GC:rs4588 and CYP2R1:rs10500804. CYP24A1:rs2296241 was significantly associated with OS and CYP2R1:rs1993116 was with SPC. These two GSVs remained significantly associated after adjusting for serum vitamin D level and important clinical factors. GSVs in the vitamin D metabolism pathway genes were associated with disease outcomes in HNC patients; however, these GSVs are different from those affecting serum vitamin D levels.

258	Sequence variation in mature microRNA-608 and benefit from neo-adjuvant treatment in locally advanced rectal cancer patients	English	2016	27381831	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27381831	Journal Article	\N	155	94	61	\N	\N	[28.0,79.0)	After central randomisation (1:1 ratio) patients received neoadjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) followed by capecitabine-based CRT, surgery and adjuvant CAPOX (four cycles) (CAPOX arm) or the same treatment plus weekly Cetuximab (CAPOX-C arm).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNA genes have been associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, survival and response to treatment. Conflicting results are available on the association between rs4919510, a SNP in mature miR-608 and clinical outcome in CRC. Here, we analyzed the association between rs4919510 and benefit from perioperative treatment in a randomised phase II trial of neoadjuvant Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin (CAPOX) followed by chemo-radiotherapy, surgery and adjuvant CAPOX ± Cetuximab in high-risk locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). A total of 155/164 (94.5%) patients were assessable. 95 (61.3%) were homozygous for CC, 55 (35.5%) heterozygous (CG) and 5 (3.2%) homozygous for GG. Median follow-up was 64.9 months. In the CAPOX arm the 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 54.6% and 60.7% for CC and 82.0% and 82.1% for CG/GG, respectively (HR PFS 0.13, 95% CI: 0.12-0.83, P = 0.02; HR OS 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14-1.01, P = 0.05). In the CAPOX-C arm PFS and OS were 73.2 and 82.2%, respectively for CC carriers and 64.6 and 73.1% for CG/GG carriers (HR PFS 1.38, 95% CI: 0.61-3.13, P = 0.44; HR OS 1.34, 95% CI: 0.52-3.48, P = 0.55). An interaction was found between study treatment and rs4919510 genotype for both PFS (P = 0.02) and OS (P = 0.07). This is the first study investigating rs4919510 in LARC. The CC genotype appeared to be associated with worse prognosis compared to the CG/GG genotype in patients treated with chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy alone. Addition of Cetuximab to chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy in CC carriers appeared to improve clinical outcome.	Carcinogenesis	\N

All patients receiving nCRT were operated on within 8 weeks after radiotherapy ended. Radical surgery consisted mainly of sphincter_saving rectal resection or abdominoperineal resection both with total mesorectal excision. Regarding the selection of the operative procedure, we considered the distance of the lesion from the anus, the comorbidities of the patient, and the condition of the anal sphincter. Post surgery, patients were administered adjuvant chemotherapy protocol for 6 months performed preferably with 5-FU or a combination of 5-FU and oxaliplatinum (one of the followed regimens: mFolFOX6 – 200 mg/㎡ folinic acid (FA) day 1, 400 mg/㎡ 5-FU bolus day 1, continued infusion for 46 hours of 2,400 mg/㎡ 5-FU and 85 mg/㎡ oxaliplatin, 14/14 day cycle; CapeOx: 1,000 mg/㎡ capecitabine twice a day, days 1-14, 130 mg/㎡ oxaliplatin day 1, 21/21 day cycle; 5-FU/FA: 200 mg/㎡ FA day 1, 400 mg/㎡ 5-FU bolus day 1, continued infusion for 46 hours of 2,400 mg/㎡ 5-FU, 14/14 day cycle).	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	AIM: To evaluate the prognostic significance and potential therapeutic implication of genetic variability in prostaglandin E2 pathway genes in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 167 patients with LARC, treated with nCRT followed by surgery. A total of 61 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were characterized using the Sequenom platform through multiplex amplification followed by mass-spectometric product separation. Surgical specimens were classified according to Mandard tumor regression grade (TRG). The patients were divided as 'good responders' (Mandard TGR1-2) and 'poor responders' (Mandard TRG3-5). We examined prognostic value of polymorphisms studied to determine if they are related to Mandard response. RESULTS: Mandard tumor response and rs17268122 in ATP binding cassette subfamily C member (ABCC4) gene were the only two parameters with independent prognostic significance for disease-free survival. CONCLUSION: tagSNP ABCC4 rs17268122 appears to be a prognostic factor in LARC treated with nCRT and surgery, independently of response to nCRT. The screening of ABCC4 rs17268122 tagSNP and the Mandard tumor response in clinical practice may help to identify patients with different rectal cancer prognosis and contribute to an individualized therapeutic decision tree.

260	The eIF3a Arg803Lys genetic polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to and chemoradiotherapy efficacy in cervical carcinoma	English	2017	28359406	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28359406	Journal Article	\N	176	\N	176	\N	\N	\N	Three different radiotherapy treatments were provided. Intracavitary irradiation was administered to cervical carcinoma patients by treating with medial-dose-rate remote afterloading intracavitary irradiation with Ir-192. The dose prescription was to point “A,” which was a reference location 2 cm above the cervical os point of the uterine tandem and 2 cm lateral to the uterine source. The total radiological dose at point A was six to seven treatments with 36-42 Gy and was completed within 6-7 weeks. For patients with exophytic cervical carcinoma, the irradiation dose was decreased 10-25 Gy, and the dose prescription was 1 cm lateral to the uterine source. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) was performed using a Co-60 teletherapy machine (Nuclear Power Institute of China, Chengdu, China). The range of the radiation field was 16-18 cm x 14 cm x 15 cm, the superior border of the pelvic field was the L4/5 border, and the inferior border was 4-5 cm below the upper margin of the pubic bone and did not exceed the center of the femoral head. A central shield (lead protection: 3-4 cm x 14-15 cm) was inserted in the radiation field after delivering 20e30 Gy to the whole pelvis, and radiation was then given to the pelvis at 15-25 Gy using an anterior and posterior 4-field box technique. Patients with para-aortic LNM received additional para-aortic irradiation, and patients with supraclavicular LNM received additional EBRTat the supraclavicular region. For chemotherapy, patients received DDP 20 mg 4 times every day by intravenous drip and 5-FU 4 g over 96 hours by continuous intravenous infusion. When the chemotherapy regimen began, patients also received radiotherapy. Patients received from three to six cycles of chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	We aimed to explore the correlations between eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit A (eIF3a) polymorphisms and susceptibility to and chemoradiotherapy efficacy in cervical carcinoma. Between August 2007 and August 2011, 176 patients with cervical carcinoma were enrolled as the case group, and 180 healthy individuals were selected as the control group. eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T genotypes were detected by hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. All patients received chemoradiotherapy and were evaluated for efficacy. Compared with carriers of the CC genotype, carriers of the T genotype of the eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism had a higher risk of cervical carcinoma. The eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism was associated with tumor size, differentiation degree, Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and lymph node metastasis (LNM). The overall response rate of the case group was 69.32% (122/176). The response rate of CC genotype carriers was higher compared to patients with the CT+TT genotypes. Binary-logistic regression analysis showed that tumor size, FIGO stage, LNM, and the eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism were influencing factors for chemoradiotherapy efficacy. Univariate analysis revealed that age, eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism, differentiation degree, FIGO stage, and LNM were prognostic factors of cervical carcinoma, and multivariate analysis showed that age ≥ 60 years, higher FIGO stage, and LNM, as well as the CT and TT genotypes of the eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism, were risk factors related to the prognosis of cervical carcinoma. The eIF3a Arg803Lys C>T polymorphism is connected with a higher susceptibility to cervical carcinoma and may affect chemoradiotherapy efficacy in and prognosis of cervical carcinoma.

261	Impact of polymorphisms in angiogenesis-related genes on clinical outcomes of radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2017	28199751	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28199751	Journal Article	\N	180	125	55	\N	50.7000000000000028	[14.0,81.0)	Among them, 36 patients received radiotherapy alone and the remainder had platinum-based radiochemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between gene polymorphism in angiogenesis-related genes and radiation responses in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients. The genotypes of 180 NPC patients were analyzed by Sequenom MassARRAY. The response evaluation criteria in solid tumours were used for assessing efficacies, and the criteria of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group or European Organization for Research & Treatment of Cancer were utilized for evaluating acute toxic reactions in response to radiation. Statistical methods included chi-square test, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Genotypic carriers of rs1800541 GT were at an elevated risk of developing grade 3+ oral mucositis, and a genetic variant of rs5333 was a predictor for a lower occurring risk of grade 2+ radiation-induced xerostomia. EDN1 rs1800541, rs2071942 and rs5370 variants were associated with a significantly higher risk of severe myelosuppression. SNPs in such angiogenesis-related genes as EDN1 rs1800541, rs2071942 & rs5370 and EDNRA rs5333 may serve as useful biomarkers for predicting the outcomes of NPC patients.

262	The impacts of single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes of cell cycle and NF-kB pathways on the efficacy and acute toxicities of radiotherapy in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma	English	2017	28445979	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28445979	Journal Article	\N	154	106	48	\N	51	[14.0,81.0)	All selected patients were treated with IMRT technique. Most patients (122) were treated with IMRT as well as chemotherapy while the other 32 were treated with IMRT alone. For nasopharyngeal primary focus and cervical positive lymph nodes, the total dose of radiotherapy was 66–70 Gy in 30–33 fractions, and for cervical drainage region, patients received 54–60 Gy in all in 30–33 fractions. One fraction was administrated daily and five fractions per week. The inductive chemotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy referred to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	Radiotherapy is one of the primary choices for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and may result in severe radiotoxicities on normal tissues. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of cell cycle and NF-κB pathways have been linked with the prognoses of various cancers. The aim of this study was to explore whether SNPs of genes involved in cell cycle and NF-κB pathways are associated with responses to radiotherapy in NPC patients. We selected 3 SNPs in cell cycle pathway and 5 SNPs in NF-κB pathway and genotyped them in 154 NPC patients treated with radiotherapy. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association of these 8 SNPs with the responses to radiotherapy. We observed that cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene CDKN2A rs3088440 was significantly related with a poorer treatment efficacy on the primary tumor and cervical lymph node after radiotherapy, and also with a decreased risk of grade 3-4 acute radiation-induced myelosuppression. In some subgroups, cyclin D1 gene CCND1 rs9344 and inhibitor of κB kinase gene IKBKB rs12676482 were related with the grade 3-4 acute radiation-induced myelosuppression, and CCND1 rs9344 was also associated with grade 3-4 acute radiation-induced oral mucositis. The current results reveal that SNPs in genes of cell cycle pathwayand NF-κB pathway have the potential to predict the clinical responses to radiotherapy for NPC patients.	Oncotarget	\N
263	Variants in nucleotide excision repair core genes and susceptibility to recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx	English	2013	23335232	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23335232	Journal Article	Non-Hispanic White; Other	658	563	95	57	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	Genetically determined capacity for NER may modulate both cancer risk and prognosis. Thus, we evaluated associations of seven selected variants in the NER core genes with recurrence risk in 658 squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (SCCOP) patients treated principally by radiation. The seven polymorphisms in the core NER genes (XPC-rs2228000, XPC-rs2228001, XPD-rs1799793, XPD-rs13181, XPG-rs17655, ERCC1-rs3212986 and XPA-rs1800975) were genotyped using PCR-RFLP method and log-rank test and multivariable Cox models were used to evaluate the associations in both dominant and recessive genetic models. In a dominant model, we found that polymorphisms of XPC-rs2228000, XPD-rs1799793 and XPG-rs17655 were significantly associated with disease-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.014; p = 0.00008; p = 0.0007, respectively), and these polymorphisms were significantly associated with recurrence risk of SCCOP (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-2.3 for XPC-rs2228000; HR = 0.4, 95% 0.3-0.6 for XPD-rs1799793 and HR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8 for XPG-rs17655) after multivariable adjustment. Moreover, the borderline significant or significant associations were also found for these three polymorphisms in HPV16/18-positive SCCOP patients (HR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0-4.1 for XPC-rs2228000; HR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.5 for XPD-rs1799793 and HR = 0.1, 95% CI 0.0-0.9 for XPG-rs17655). However, similarly significant associations were not found for these polymorphisms in a recessive model. These findings suggest that polymorphisms of XPC-rs2228000, XPD-rs1799793 and XPG-rs17655 in the NER core genes may contribute to recurrence risk of SCCOP, particularly HPV-positive SCCOP, in a dominant but not in a recessive model. However, validation of these results is warranted.	International Journal of Cancer	Stage I-II: 49 patients, Stage III-IV: 609 patients.
264	TNF-α promoter polymorphisms and risk of recurrence in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the nonoropharynx	English	2014	24550071	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24550071	Journal Article	\N	530	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Functional polymorphisms of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) may play a critical role in the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses and could affect transcriptional levels of the TNF-α gene and thus contribute to carcinogenesis and outcomes of cancer patients. In a cohort study, we explored the associations between TNF-α polymorphisms and risk of recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma of the nonoropharynx (SCCNOP). We used log-rank test and multivariable Cox models to evaluate the associations between TNF-α polymorphisms and risk of recurrence. In overall comparisons, patients with the TNF-α -857 CC, TNF-α -863 CC and TNF-α -1031 TT genotypes had significantly worse disease-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.014, log-rank, p = .020, and log-rank, p = .002, respectively) and higher risk of disease recurrence than patients with the corresponding variant genotypes, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.4, 95% CI, 1.1-1.9, HR, 1.4, 95% CI, 1.0-1.8 and HR, 1.6, 95% CI, 1.2-2.2, respectively). However, no significant association was detected for the TNF-α -308 polymorphism. Moreover, in further stratified analyses based on smoking status and treatment, we found that the associations of the TNF-α -857, TNF-α -863 and TNF-α -1031 polymorphisms with risk of recurrence were more pronounced in smokers and patients treated with chemoradiation. Our findings support a significant role of the TNF-α -857, TNF-α -863 and TNF-α -1031 polymorphisms in recurrence of SCCNOP, especially in smokers and patients treated with chemoradiation. Future prospective studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.	International Journal of Cancer	\N

For early oral cancers (T1/T0 with N0), wide excision with neck dissection was opted, whereas, in advanced cases (T3/T4, N0/N+), wide excision with reconstruction and neck dissection was carried out. Patients were then subjected to postoperative adjuvant radiation therapy (external) based on the pathology report. Treatment wise, the majority of patients received radiation therapy alone (111/341, 35.7 %) or in combination with surgery and or chemotherapy (229/311, 74 %).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy + Surgery	5	Oral cancer is a dreadful disease with a wide variation in geographical distribution. In order to identify some useful biomarkers for the disease prognosis, the present study assessed the influence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cell cycle genes on survival in a well-annotated set of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The study examined 12 sequence variants or SNPs in selected cell cycle genes, with prognostic outcomes in 311 oral cancer patients. Our analysis showed that SNPs in cyclin D1:rs9344 and retinoblastoma:rs427686 genes showed a strong correlation with disease-free survival. In addition, the cumulative effect of these SNPs significantly and independently predicts the survival. Thus, the current study identified genotypes (SNP signature), which can be used as novel prognostic biomarkers to stratify patients based on disease-free survival and therefore maybe helpful in therapeutic decision-making.

267	Melanocortin Receptor-4 Gene Polymorphisms in Glioblastoma Patients Treated with Concomitant Radio-Chemotherapy	English	2017	28150230	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28150230	Journal Article	\N	55	27	28	58	56.6000000000000014	[24.0,80.0)	RT was delivered to surgical bed plus residual disease with 2 cm of margin; the total dose delivered was 60 Gy in 30 fractions. CT was represented by TMZ that was administered at the dose of 75 mg/㎡/day during the RT time and of 150–200 mg/㎡/day for 5 days every 28 days during 6–12 cycles, until disease progression or toxicity occurrence.	Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy	5	Melanocortins are peptides with well-recognized antiinflammatory and neuroprotective activity. No data are currently available on melanocortin receptor-4 (MC4R) gene polymorphisms and tumors, including glioblastomas (GBMs), or their relationship with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible predictive/prognostic role of the MC4R SNPs on GBM patients. Fifty-five patients with a proven diagnosis of GBM, treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, were consecutively enrolled. MC4R gene SNPs (rs17782313, rs489693, rs8087522, rs17700633) were analyzed by a validated TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A P < 0.0125 (Bonferroni's correction) was considered significant ( Clinicaltrial.gov identifier NCT02458508). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) of these patients were 9.54 (95% CI 5.4-14.3) months and 24.9 (95% CI 17.8-34.6) months, respectively. The MC4R rs489693 AA genotype was significantly associated with a shorter PFS and OS. Indeed, with regard to PFS, patients harboring the rs489693 AA genotype had a median PFS of 2.99 months whereas patients with AC/CC genotypes had a median PFS of 10.82 months (P = 0.009). Interestingly, the rs489693 AA patients also had a lower median OS as compared with the median OS of the AC/CC genotypes (10.75 vs. 29.5 months, respectively, P = 0.0001). This study suggests that the MC4R rs489693 AA genotype is significantly associated with a shorter PFS and OS in patients treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide. These findings represent a relevant effort to identify novel clinical markers for RT-CT therapy in GBM to be validated in future pharmacogenetic clinical trials.	Molecular Neurobiology	\N
268	HSPB1 gene polymorphisms predict risk of mortality for US patients after radio(chemo)therapyfor non-small cell lung cancer	English	2012	22608953	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22608953	Journal Article	White; Black; Asian	224	117	107	70	\N	[39.0,93.0)	The median total radiation dose for all patients was 66 Gy (range, 63-87.5 Gy) at 1.2-2 Gy/fraction (57 patients [25%] received 69.6 Gy/58 fractions at 1.2 Gy/ fraction twice per day); 20% of patients received a dose greater than 70 Gy. Most patients (81.7%) also received concurrent platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy. Therapies received included induction chemotherapy followed by radiation (nZ15), induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation (nZ74), and concurrent chemotherapy and radiation without induction treatment (nZ109). Twenty-three patients were treated with radiation alone; three patients subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy ± Surgery	5	PURPOSE: We investigated potential associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the heat shock protein beta-1 (HSPB1) gene and overall survival in US patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using available genomic DNA samples from 224 patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radio(chemo)therapy, we genotyped 2 SNPs of HSPB1 (NCBI SNP nos. rs2868370 and rs2868371). We used both Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability and Cox proportional hazards analyses to evaluate the effect of HSPB1 genotypes on survival. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 117 men and 107 women, mostly white (79.5%), with a median age of 70 years. The median radiation dose was 66 Gy (range, 63-87.5 Gy), and 183 patients (82%) received concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. The most common genotype of the rs2868371 SNP was CC (61%). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that this genotype was associated with poorer survival than CG and GG genotypes (univariate hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.90; P=.037; multivariate HR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.92; P=.045). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the CC genotype of HSPB1 rs2868371 was associated with poorer overall survival in patients with NSCLC after radio(chemo)therapy, findings that contradict those of a previous study of Chinese patients. Validation of our findings with larger numbers of similar patients is needed, as are mechanical and clinical studies to determine the mechanism underlying these associations.

In addition, 24 patients (80.0%) received chemotherapy; among these, 5 received induction chemotherapy and 19 received induction chemotherapy and adjuvant concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT).	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the susceptibility of severe oral mucositis (OM) in Chinese nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients treated with radiotherapy and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome. SNPs were screened in a total of 24 patients with NPC and an additional 6 were subjected to mRNA expression analysis. Patients were subdivided into CTC 0-2 (CTC toxicity grade 0, 1, and 2) and CTC 3+ (CTC toxicity grade 3 and above) groups according to their CTC (common toxicity criteria) scores. The GTEx dataset was used to performed eQTL analyses and in-vitro functional assays were performed for eQTL-associated genes. Our data identified 7 functional SNPs associated with the development of OM. We observed that rs11081899-A, located in the 5'-UTR of the ZNF24 gene, was significantly correlated with a higher risk of severe mucositis (OR = 14.631, 95% CI = 2.61-105.46, p = 1.2 × 10-4), and positively associated with ZNF24 mRNA expression (p = 4.1 × 10-6) from GTEx dataset. In addition, high ZNF24 mRNA expression was associated with severe OM in patients with NPC (p = 0.02). Further functional assays revealed that ZNF24 knockdown reduced p65 expression and suppressed TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines release. These findings suggested that rs11081899-A may be a genetic susceptibility factor for radiation-induced OM in patients with NPC, although its value in clinical application needs to be further verified in a large cohort. Also, we suggested that downregulation of ZNF24 may attenuate the development of mucositis by suppressing NF-κB activation.	Oncotarget	Stage I-II: 7 patients, Stage III-IV: 23 patients.

RT was given 5 times a week at 2 Gy/d. The accu- mulated radiation dose to the primary tumor was 68 to 72 Gy. The accumulated dose was 60 to 62 Gy to the involved areas of the neck and 50 Gy to the uninvolved areas. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was given to 26 patients, and induction plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy to 141 patients. As induction chemotherapy, 2 cycles of PF chemotherapy [DDP (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II) 100 mg/㎡ i.v. drip on day 1 and 5-FU 1,000 mg/(㎡ d) continuous i.v. for 120 hours] repeated every 3 weeks were given. As concurrent chemoradiotherapy, DDP 100 mg/㎡ on days 1, 22, and 43 during radiotherapy, or DDP 40 mg/㎡ once weekly during radiotherapy was given.	Radiotherapy ± Chemotherapy	5	PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate the prognostic role of endothelin-1 (EDN1) and endothelin A receptor (EDNRA) gene polymorphisms in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two hundred three consecutive patients with locoregionally advanced NPC were enrolled. Seven potentially functional polymorphisms in the EDN1 and EDNRA genes were determined by ligase detection reaction-PCR method from prospectively collected blood samples. The influence of the genetic polymorphisms on patient overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model, Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test. RESULTS: The 5-year OS in patients with EDNRA/H323H TT, TC, and CC genotypes were 81.3%, 62.1%, and 75.0%, respectively (P = 0.004). Patients carrying the heterozygous (TC) or homozygous variant (CC) genotype in EDNRA/H323H were combined for analysis, which revealed that the 5-year OS in patients with TC/CC genotypes was significantly lower than those with the wild-type TT genotype (63.2% vs. 81.3%; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that EDNRA/H323H polymorphism (HR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.18-3.23; P = 0.009) and N classification (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.03-1.79; P = 0.03) were independent significant prognostic factors for OS in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. In contrast, the EDN1 polymorphisms revealed no prognostic value. CONCLUSIONS: The EDNRA/H323H polymorphism was a novel and independent prognostic marker for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. The analysis of EDNRA/H323H polymorphism may help identify patient subgroups at high risk for poor disease outcome.	Clinical Cancer Research	Stage III: 143 patients, Stage IV: 60 patients.
