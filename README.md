## About Knowledgebase

The RTPDB (Radiotherapy Prognosis Database) is a tumor prognosis resource that focus on the relationship between human genetic variation or gene expression and prognosis of patients who received radiotherapy with or without other treatments. RTPDB collects, curates and disseminates data about the impact of human genetic variation on prognosis of cancer patients. Now, we mainly focus on the association between single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or gene expression and prognosis. Mutations in other type will be included in turn.
